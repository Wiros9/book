Overview
========

A **ledger** is a book in which the monetary transactions of a business are
posted in the form of debits and credits (from `1
<http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ledger>`__).

In Lino, the ledger is implemented by three database models:

.. glossary::

  ledger voucher

    Any document that serves as legal proof for a :term:`ledger transaction` in
    the ledger. Examples of vouchers include invoices, bank statements, or
    payment orders, VAT declarations, ...

    Vouchers are stored in the database using some subclass of the
    :class:`Voucher` model. The voucher model is never being used directly
    despite the fact that it is a concrete model.

  journal

    A series of sequentially numbered :term:`vouchers <ledger voucher>`.

  ledger movement

    An atomic "transfer" of a given *amount* of money from (or to) a given
    :term:`ledger account` at a given date.  It is just a *conceptual* transfer,
    not a cash or bank transfer.

    Moving money *from* (out of) an account is called "to debit", moving money
    *to* an account is called "to credit".

    Movements are never created individually but by registering a :term:`ledger
    voucher`.

  ledger account

    The most abstract representation for "something where you can place money
    and retrieve it later".

    An account always has a given balance which can be negative or positive.

    In applications which use the :mod:`ledger <lino_xl.lib.ledger>` plugin,
    accounts are used as the target of :term:`ledger movements <ledger
    movement>`.

  payable transaction

    A transaction that is expected to cause a payment by a partner.

    For example sales invoices, purchase invoices, VAT declarations are payable
    transactions.



Some more concepts:

.. glossary::

  ledger transaction

    The group of :term:`movements <ledger movement>` generated by a same
    :term:`ledger voucher`. For each transaction there must be at least two movements
    for which the sum of *debited* money equals the sum of *credited* money.

    A transaction always happens at a given date and in a given
    :term:`accounting period` which itself is part of a given :term:`fiscal
    year`.

  common account

    A well-known account for which the :term:`site manager` must configure
    a corresponding account of your accounts chart. See :class:`CommonAccounts`.

  fiscal year

    A sequence of consecutive :term:`accounting periods <accounting period>`
    covered by an annual business activity report.

    This usually corresponds to a calendar year. But not always. Exceptions may
    be companies having a shifted annual report or transitional periods.

    When the annual report has been published (declared to the national tax
    office), the fiscal year should be closed to prevent accidental changes in
    the ledger of that year.

  accounting period

    The month or quarter into which a given transaction is booked.
    Usually the same as the calendar month of the voucher's entry date.

  invoice

    A :term:`ledger voucher` sent to or received from a business partner,
    showing a list of goods or services, their price, and the amount due.

  product invoice

    An :term:`invoice` that is also a :term:`trade document`, i.e. the items of
    which point to a :term:`product`.

    Each :term:`product` mentioned in the items maps to a :term:`ledger account`
    according to configurable rules.

  account invoice

    An :term:`invoice` where each row points directly to ledger accounts and
    doesn't mention any :term:`product`. This is in contrast to an
    :term:`product invoice`.

    In a default :ref:`cosi` site, purchase invoices are implemented as
    :term:`account invoices <account invoice>` while sales invoices are
    :term:`product invoices <product invoice>`.

  paycheck

    A :term:`ledger voucher` sent to each employee every month, detailing the
    amount of the salary or wage and resulting tax and other legal transactions.

  bank statement

    A :term:`ledger voucher` received from the bank, showing all transactions on
    a given account during a given date range.

  cash book

    A :term:`journal` of all transactions in a given cash box.

    The transactions are grouped into **cash statements**, which are similar to
    a :term:`bank statement`, but issued internally and potentially to be signed
    by a responsible person.

  preliminary transactions

    Transactions that happened before the accounting period they are recorded
    for. They are part of the opening balance, but not to be considered as part
    of the actual accounting period's history.

    They are used to enter any relevant account activity of a corporation that
    has been booked using another software and/or database.

    Note that opening entries, i.e. transactions made at the start of an
    organization as part of the foundation process, are are not preliminary.

    In Lino, you create them in a dedicated journal that has its
    :attr:`preliminary <Journal.preliminary>` field checked.

  trade type

    The type of a trade operation. For example "sales" and "purchases" are the
    most common trade types.  But we can also have "salaries", "taxes", ...  See
    `Trade types`_

There are some secondary models and choice lists:


- A **match rule** specifies that a movement into given account can
  be cleared using a given journal.

- The **payment term** of an invoice (:class:`PaymentTerm`) is a convention on how the
  invoice should be paid.

And then there are many views for looking at this data.

- :class:`GeneralAccountsBalance`, :class:`CustomerAccountsBalance` and
  :class:`SupplierAccountsBalance`

- :class:`Debtors` and :class:`Creditors` are tables with one row for
  each partner who has a positive balance (either debit or credit).
  Accessible via :menuselection:`Reports --> Ledger --> Debtors` and
  :menuselection:`Reports --> Ledger --> Creditors`

Accounts
========

.. class:: Account

    Django model for representing a :term:`ledger account`.

    .. attribute:: name

        The multilingual designation of this account, as the users see
        it.

    .. attribute:: ref

        An optional unique name which can be used to reference a given
        account.

    .. attribute:: type

        The *account type* of this account.  This points to an item of
        :class:`CommonAccounts`.

    .. attribute:: needs_partner

        Whether bookings to this account need a partner specified.

        For payment orders this causes the contra entry of financial
        documents to be detailed or not (i.e. one contra entry for
        every item or a single contra entry per voucher.

    .. attribute:: vat_class

        The default VAT class to use for transactions on this account.

    .. attribute:: default_amount

        The default amount to book in bank statements or journal
        entries when this account has been selected manually. The
        default booking direction is that of the :attr:`type`.

    .. attribute:: purchases_allowed
    .. attribute:: sales_allowed
    .. attribute:: wages_allowed
    .. attribute:: clearings_allowed
    .. attribute:: FOO_allowed

        These checkboxes indicate whether this account can be used on
        an item of a purchases (or sales or wages or FOO)
        invoice. There is one such checkbox for every trade type
        (:class:`TradeTypes <lino_xl.lib.ledger.TradeTypes>`).  They
        exist only when the :mod:`ledger <lino_xl.lib.ledger>` plugin
        is installed as well.  See also the
        :meth:`get_allowed_accounts
        <lino_xl.lib.ledger.Journal.get_allowed_accounts>` method.

    .. attribute:: needs_ana

        Whether transactions on this account require the user to also
        specify an analytic account.

        This file exists only when :mod:`lino_xl.lib.ana` is
        installed as well.

    .. attribute:: ana_account

        Which analytic account to suggest for transactions on this
        account.

        This file exists only when :mod:`lino_xl.lib.ana` is
        installed as well.

    .. attribute:: sheet_item

        Pointer to the item of the balance sheet or income statement
        that will report the movements of this account.

        This file is a dummy field when :mod:`lino_xl.lib.sheets` is
        not installed.



Common accounts
===============

The `accounts` plugin defines a choicelist of **common accounts**
which are used to reference the database object for certain accounts
which have a special meaning.

.. class:: CommonAccounts

    The global list of common accounts.

    This is a :class:`lino.core.choicelists.ChoiceList`.
    Every item is an instance of :class:`CommonAccount`.

    This list is automatically sorted at startup because it is populated by
    several plugins, and because the natural sorting order would be useless and
    irritating.

.. class:: CommonAccount

    The base class for items of ::class:`CommonAccounts`.

    It defines two additional attributes:

    .. attribute:: clearable

        Default value for :attr:`Account.clearable`.

    .. attribute:: needs_partner

        Default value for :attr:`Account.needs_partner`.

    .. method:: get_object(self)

        Return the database object representing this common account.

    .. method:: set_object(self, obj)

        Set the cached database object representing this common account.

        Called internally when :attr:`Account.common_account` is updated via web
        interface.


Here is the standard list of common accounts in a :ref:`cosi`
application:

======= ========================= ========================= =========== ================================
<BLANKLINE>

Lino applications can add specific items to that list or potentially redefine it
completely.

Keep in mind that common accounts are no database objects.   See them rather as
a list of configuration values. They are just a list of named pointers to
actual database objects.

For example you might want to know how many sales operations are in your
database:

>>> obj = ledger.CommonAccounts.sales.get_object()
>>> obj
Account #20 ('(7000) Sales')
>>> ledger.Movement.objects.filter(account=obj).count()
92

A common account neither requires nor makes sure that its database object
exists. For example the common account "Net loss" has no database object in the
accounts chart pointing to it.  The above trick won't work for counting the
number of net loss operations:

>>> obj = ledger.CommonAccounts.net_loss.get_object()
>>> obj
MissingAccount(<ledger.CommonAccounts.net_loss:7900>)
>>> ledger.Movement.objects.filter(account=obj).count()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Field 'id' expected a number but got MissingAccount(<ledger.CommonAccounts.net_loss:7900>).



Debit and credit
================

.. data:: DEBIT
.. data:: CREDIT

Every movement of a financial transaction "moves" some amount either **out of**
or **into** a given account.  For some reasons beyond the scope of this book,
accountants didn't want to express this "direction" of a movement simply by
using either a positive or a negative number, they wanted an explicit word for
it and called it **debiting** and **crediting**.

We represent the direction of a movement internally as the boolean values
`True` and `False`, but define two names :data:`DEBIT` and :data:`CREDIT` for
them:

>>> from lino_xl.lib.ledger.utils import DEBIT, CREDIT
>>> DEBIT
False
>>> CREDIT
True

Since it is a boolean field, some frontends might represent it as a checkbox.
In that case remember that **checked** means credit and **not checked** means
debit.

The balance of an account
=========================

The **balance** of an account is the amount of money in that account.
An account balance is either Debit or Credit.

.. class:: Balance

    Light-weight object to represent a balance, i.e. an amount
    together with its booking direction (debit or credit).

    Attributes:

    .. attribute:: d

        The amount of this balance when it is debiting, otherwise zero.

    .. attribute:: c

        The amount of this balance when it is crediting, otherwise zero.


A negative value on one side of the balance is automatically moved to
the other side.

>>> from lino_xl.lib.ledger.utils import Balance
>>> Balance(10, -2)
Balance(12,0)



Database fields
===============

.. class:: DebitOrCreditField

    A field that stores the "direction" of a movement, i.e. either
    :data:`DEBIT` or :data:`CREDIT`.


.. class:: DebitOrCreditStoreField

    Uused as `lino_atomizer_class` for :class:`DebitOrCreditField`.


Movements
=========


.. class:: Movement

    Django model used to represent a :term:`ledger movement`

    .. attribute:: value_date

        The date at which this movement is to be entered into the
        ledger.  This is usually the voucher's :attr:`entry_date
        <lino_xl.lib.ledger.models.Voucher.entry_date>`, except
        e.g. for bank statements where each item can have its own
        value date.

    .. attribute:: voucher

        Pointer to the :term:`ledger voucher` that caused this movement.

    .. attribute:: partner

        Pointer to the partner involved in this movement.

        If :attr:`account` has :attr:`Account.needs_partner` set, this may not
        be blank, otherwise it must be blank.

    .. attribute:: seqno

        Sequential number within a voucher.

    .. attribute:: account

        Pointer to the :class:`Account` that is being moved by this movement.

    .. attribute:: debit

        Virtual field showing :attr:`amount` if :attr:`dc` is DEBIT.

    .. attribute:: credit

        Virtual field showing :attr:`amount` if :attr:`dc` is CREDIT.

    .. attribute:: amount

    .. attribute:: dc

    .. attribute:: match

        Pointer to the :class:`Movement` that is being cleared by this
        movement.

    .. attribute:: cleared

        Whether

    .. attribute:: voucher_partner

        A virtual field which returns the *partner of the voucher*.
        For incoming invoices this is the supplier, for outgoing
        invoices this is the customer, for financial vouchers this is
        empty.

    .. attribute:: voucher_link

        A virtual field which shows a link to the voucher.

    .. attribute:: match_link

        A virtual field which shows a clickable variant of the match
        string. Clicking it will open a table with all movements
        having that match.


    .. attribute:: ana_account

        The analytic account to move together with this transactions.

        This file exists only when :mod:`lino_xl.lib.ana` is
        installed as well.

.. class:: Movements

    The base table for all tables having :term:`ledger movements <ledger
    movement>` as rows.

    Defines filtering parameters and general behaviour.

    .. attribute:: start_period
    .. attribute:: end_period
    .. attribute:: start_date
    .. attribute:: end_date
    .. attribute:: cleared
    .. attribute:: journal_group
    .. attribute:: journal
    .. attribute:: year
    .. attribute:: project
    .. attribute:: partner
    .. attribute:: account


.. class:: MovementsByPartner

   Shows the ledger movements linked to a given partner.

.. class:: MovementsByAccount

    Shows the ledger movements done on a given general account.

    .. attribute:: description

        A virtual field showing a comma-separated list of the
        following items:

        - voucher narration
        - voucher partner
        - transaction's partner
        - transaction's project


.. class:: MovementsByMatch

    Show all movements having a given :attr:`Movement.match`.

    This is another example of a slave table whose master is not a database
    object, and the first example of a slave table whose master is a simple
    string.

.. class:: MovementsByProject

    Show the ledger movements of a project.

.. class:: AllMovements

    Show all the ledger movements in the database.

    Displayed by :menuselection:`Explorer --> Accounting --> Movements`.

.. class:: MovementsByVoucher

    Show the ledger movements generated by a given voucher.


The summary of :class:`MovementsByPartner` shows a *balance*. A negative number
means that we owe money to this partner, a positive number means that this
partner owes us money.

For example David da Vinci has 4 open invoices:

>>> obj = rt.models.contacts.Person.objects.get(pk=165)
>>> obj
Person #165 ('Mr David da Vinci')

>>> rt.show(rt.models.ledger.MovementsByPartner, obj)
**2 open movements (1946.43 €)**

>>> rt.show(rt.models.ledger.MovementsByPartner, obj, nosummary=True)

Vouchers
========

.. class:: Voucher

    Django model used to represent a :term:`ledger voucher`.

    This model is *not* abstract so that :class:`Movement` can have a
    ForeignKey to a Voucher.

    A voucher is never instantiated using this base model but using one of its
    subclasses.  Here are the voucher subclasses available in :ref:`cosi`:

    >>> pprint(rt.models_by_base(ledger.Voucher))
    [<class 'lino_xl.lib.bevat.models.Declaration'>,
     <class 'lino_xl.lib.finan.models.BankStatement'>,
     <class 'lino_xl.lib.finan.models.JournalEntry'>,
     <class 'lino_xl.lib.finan.models.PaymentOrder'>,
     <class 'lino_xl.lib.ledger.models.Voucher'>,
     <class 'lino_xl.lib.sales.models.VatProductInvoice'>,
     <class 'lino_xl.lib.vat.models.VatAccountInvoice'>]

    When the partner of an empty voucher has a purchase account, Lino
    automatically creates a voucher item using this account with empty
    amount.


    .. attribute:: state

        The workflow state of this voucher.

        This field is defined by the implementing voucher class, which depends
        on the journal's voucher type.

        Choices are defined in
        :class:`VoucherStates`

    .. attribute:: journal

        The journal into which this voucher has been booked. This is a
        mandatory pointer to a :class:`Journal` instance.

    .. attribute:: number

        The sequence number of this voucher in the :attr:`journal`.

        The voucher number is automatically assigned when the voucher
        is saved for the first time.  The voucher number depends on
        whether :attr:`yearly_numbering` is enabled or not.

        There might be surprising numbering if two users create
        vouchers in a same journal at the same time.

    .. attribute:: entry_date

        The date of the journal entry, i.e. when this voucher is to
        journalized or booked.

    .. attribute:: voucher_date

        The date on the voucher (i.e. when it has been issued by its
        emitter).

        This is usually the same as :attr:`entry_date`.  Exceptions
        may be invoices arriving after their fiscal year has been
        closed.  Note that if you change :attr:`entry_date` of a
        voucher, then Lino will set the :attr:`voucher_date` to that
        date.

    .. attribute:: accounting_period

        The :term:`accounting period` to use when booking this voucher.
        The default value is determined from :attr:`entry_date`.

        If user changes this field, the :attr:`number` gets
        re-computed because it might change depending on the fiscal
        year of the accounting period.


    .. attribute:: narration

        A short explanation which ascertains the subject matter of
        this journal entry.

    .. attribute:: number_with_year

      A text like "2019-12".

    .. method:: do_and_clear(func, do_clear)

        Delete all movements of this voucher, then run the given
        callable `func`, passing it a set with all partners who had at
        least one movement in this voucher. The function is expected
        to add more partners to this set.  Then call :func:`check_clearings`
        for all these partners.

    .. method:: create_movement(item, acc_tuple, project, dc, amount, **kw):

        Create a movement for this voucher.

        The specified `item` may be `None` if this the movement is
        caused by more than one item.  It is used by
        :class:`DatedFinancialVoucher
        <lino_xl.lib.finan.DatedFinancialVoucher>`.

    .. method:: get_partner()

        Return the partner related to this voucher.  Overridden by
        PartnerRelated vouchers.

    .. method:: get_movement_description(self, ar)

        Generate a series of HTML chunks to be displayed in the
        :attr:`Movment.description` field.

    .. method:: get_wanted_movements()

        Subclasses must implement this.  Supposed to return or yield a
        list of unsaved :class:`Movement` instances.

    .. method:: get_mti_leaf(self):

        Return the specialized form of this voucher.

        From any :class:`Voucher` instance we can get the actual
        document (Invoice, PaymentOrder, BankStatement, ...) by
        calling this method.

Registering a voucher
=====================

A :term:`ledger voucher` is always in one of the three states "Draft", "Registered" or
"Cancelled". "Registering a voucher" means to change it status from "Draft" to
"Registered".

When a voucher is registered, it receives a sequence number in its
:term:`journal` and Lino generates the :term:`movements <ledger movement>`
according to the data in the voucher.

A registered voucher cannot be edited or deleted.

You can **deregister** a voucher at any moment (except when you lack permission
for this actions, or when the voucher is in a :term:`fiscal year` that has been
closed).

When you deregister a voucher, all :term:`movements <ledger movement>` are deleted.




.. class:: RegistrableVoucher

  .. attribute:: toggle_state

    Toggle between "registered" and "draft" state.

    A one-click action to quickly toggle between the two the most-used
    states of a voucher.

    >>> finan.BankStatement.toggle_state.help_text
    'Toggle between "registered" and "draft" state.'

  .. attribute:: hide_editable_number

    We usually don't want to see the number of a voucher in an editable state
    because that number may change. We prefer to see the primary key prefixed
    with a hash to indicate that the voucher is not registered.  But e.g. in
    :mod:`lino_xl.lib.orders` we want to disable this feature.

    NB we might simply override :meth:`__str__`, but maybe this feature will be
    used in other contexts as well.



The state of a voucher is stored in a field :attr:`voucher_state
<lino_xl.lib.ledger.Voucher.voucher_state>`. The available states and the rules
for changing the state are called the workflow.

.. class:: ToggleState

    The action behind :attr:`RegistrableVoucher.toggle_state`.

.. class:: Journal

    Django model used to represent a :term:`journal`.

    **Fields:**

    .. attribute:: ref
    .. attribute:: trade_type

        Pointer to :class:`TradeTypes`.

    .. attribute:: voucher_type

        Pointer to an item of :class:`VoucherTypes`.

    .. attribute:: journal_group

        Pointer to an item of :class:`JournalGroups`.

    .. attribute:: yearly_numbering

        Whether the :attr:`number <lino_xl.lib.ledger.Voucher.number>` of
        vouchers should restart at 1 every year.

    .. attribute:: force_sequence

    .. attribute:: preliminary

        Whether transactions in this journal are considered :term:`preliminary
        <preliminary transactions>`.

    .. attribute:: account

        The account to use for the counter-movements generated by
        vouchers in this journal.

    .. attribute:: partner

        The partner to use as default partner for all vouchers in this
        journal.

    .. attribute:: printed_name

    .. attribute:: dc

        The primary booking direction (checked means Credit, unchecked Debit).

        In a journal of *sales invoices* this should be *Debit*
        (checked), because a positive invoice total should be
        *debited* from the customer's account.

        In a journal of *purchase invoices* this should be *Credit*
        (not checked), because a positive invoice total should be
        *credited* to the supplier's account.

        In a journal of *bank statements* this should be *Debit*
        (checked), because a positive balance change should be
        *debited* from the bank's general account.

        In a journal of *payment orders* this should be *Credit* (not
        checked), because a positive total means an "expense" and
        should be *credited* from the journal's general account.

        In all financial vouchers, the amount of every item increases
        the total if its direction is opposite of the primary
        direction.

    .. attribute:: auto_check_clearings

        Whether to automatically check and update the 'cleared' status
        of involved transactions when (de)registering a voucher of
        this journal.

        This can be temporarily disabled e.g. by batch actions in
        order to save time.

    .. attribute:: auto_fill_suggestions

        Whether to automatically fill voucher item from due payments
        of the partner when entering a financial voucher.

    .. attribute:: template

        See :attr:`PrintableType.template
        <lino.mixins.printable.PrintableType.template>`.

    .. attribute:: sepa_account

        Your bank account to specify in payment order.

        Added by :doc:`sepa`.


.. class:: Journals

  List of all Journals. Accessible via :menuselection:`Configure --> Accounting

.. class:: JournalsOverview

    The list of all Journals shown in the dashboard.

    This is used as the primary dashboard item in :ref:`cosi`. It gives an idea
    of how much data is in the database, and it adds links for quickly opening a
    journal (which is after all one of the frequent actions in an accounting
    application).

So the balance of a supplier's account (when open) is usually on the
*credit* side (they gave us money) while a customer's balance is
usually on the *debit* side (they owe us money).

Ledger info
===========

.. class:: LedgerInfo

    Django model used to store ledger specific information per user.

    .. attribute:: user

        OneToOneField pointing to the user.

    .. attribute:: entry_date

        The last value this user typed as :attr:`entry_date
        <Voucher.entry_date>` of a voucher.  It is the default value
        for every new voucher.

    .. classmethod:: get_by_user(self, user)

        Returns the ledger info entry for a given user.


Match rules
===========

.. class:: MatchRule

    Django model used to store *match rules*.


Payment terms
=============


.. class:: PaymentTerm

    Django model used to store *payment terms*.

    The following fields define the default value for `due_date`:

    .. attribute:: days

        Number of days to add to :attr:`voucher_date`.

    .. attribute:: months

        Number of months to add to :attr:`voucher_date`.

    .. attribute:: end_of_month

        Whether to move :attr:`voucher_date` to the end of month.

    .. attribute:: worker

        The worker who pays or collects the invoice using :ref:`internal_clearings`.

    .. attribute:: printed_text

        Used in :xfile:`sales/VatProductInvoice/trailer.html` as
        follows::

            {% if obj.payment_term.printed_text %}
            {{parse(obj.payment_term.printed_text)}}
            {% else %}
            {{_("Payment terms")}} : {{obj.payment_term}}
            {% endif %}

    The :attr:`printed_text` field is important when using
    **prepayments** or other more complex payment terms.  Lino uses a
    rather simple approach to handle prepayment invoices: only the
    global amount and the final due date is stored in the database,
    all intermediate amounts and due dates are just generated in the
    printable document. You just define one :class:`PaymentTerm
    <lino_xl.lib.ledger.models.PaymentTerm>` row for each prepayment
    formula and configure your :attr:`printed_text` field. For
    example::

        Prepayment <b>30%</b>
        ({{(obj.total_incl*30)/100}} {{obj.currency}})
        due on <b>{{fds(obj.due_date)}}</b>, remaining
        {{obj.total_incl - (obj.total_incl*30)/100}} {{obj.currency}}
        due 10 days before delivery.

Accounting periods
==================

.. class:: AccountingPeriod

    An **accounting period** is the smallest time slice to be observed
    (declare) in accounting reports. Usually it corresponds to one
    *month*. Except for some small companies which declare per
    quarter.

    For each period it is possible to specify the exact dates during
    which it is allowed to register vouchers into this period, and
    also its "state": whether it is "closed" or not.

    .. attribute:: start_date
    .. attribute:: end_date
    .. attribute:: state
    .. attribute:: year
    .. attribute:: ref

.. class:: SuppliersAccountsBalance

    A :class:`PartnerAccountsBalance` for the TradeType "purchases".

.. class:: DebtorsCreditors

    Abstract base class for different tables showing a list of
    partners with the following columns:

      partner due_date balance actions

.. class:: Debtors

    Shows partners who have some debt against us.
    Inherits from :class:`DebtorsCreditors`.

.. class:: Creditors

    Shows partners who give us some form of credit.
    Inherits from :class:`DebtorsCreditors`.

The :term:`trade type` is one of the basic properties of every ledger operation
that involves an external partner.  Every movement involving a partner is of one

Your application might have a different list.  You can see the
actually configured list for your site via :menuselection:`Explorer
--> Accounting --> Trade types`.


.. class:: TradeTypes

    The choicelist with the *trade types* defined for this
    application.

    The default configuration defines the following trade types:

    .. attribute:: sales

        When you write an invoice to a customer and when the customer pays it.

    .. attribute:: purchases

        When you get an invoice from a provider and when you pay it.

    .. attribute:: wages

        When you write a payroll (declare the fact that you owe some wage to an
        employee) and later pay it (e.g. via a payment order).

Match rules
===========

A **match rule** specifies that a movement into given account can be
*cleared* using a given journal.

You can configure match rules either in the detail view of a journal or
globally via :menuselection:`Explorer --> Accounting --> Match rules`.

The demo database has the following match rules:

Debtors
=======

**Debtors** are partners who received credit from us and therefore are
in debt towards us.

The most common debtors are customers, i.e. partners who received a sales
invoice from us and did not yet pay that invoice.

There can be debtors who are not customers.  For example a bank or a tax office.
A bank is a debtor when pending payment orders are booked to this account.  A
tax office is a debtor when we had more VAT deductible (sales) than VAT due
(purchases).

Fiscal years
============

Lino has a table of **fiscal years**.  A fiscal year often corresponds
to the calendar year, but not necessarily.

If :mod:`lino_xl.lib.sheets` is installed, the detail window of a
FiscalYear object shows the financial reports (balance sheet and
income statement) for this year.

.. class:: FiscalYear

    .. attribute:: start_date
    .. attribute:: end_date
    .. attribute:: state

.. class:: FiscalYears

    The fiscal years available in this database.



The :mod:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.fixtures.std` fixture fills this table
with 5 years starting from :attr:`start_year
<lino_xl.lib.ledger.Plugin.start_year>`.

Each ledger movement happens in a given **accounting period**.
An accounting period usually corresponds to a month of the calendar.

The *reference* of a new accounting period is computed by applying the
voucher's entry date to the template defined in the :attr:`date_to_period_tpl
<lino_xl.lib.ledger.AccountingPeriod.get_for_date>` attribute of the ledger
plugin.  The default implementation leads to the following references:

>>> print(ledger.AccountingPeriod.get_ref_for_date(i2d(19940202)))
1994-02
>>> print(ledger.AccountingPeriod.get_ref_for_date(i2d(20150228)))
2015-02
>>> print(ledger.AccountingPeriod.get_ref_for_date(i2d(20150401)))
2015-04

You may manually create additional accounting periods. For example

- `2015-00` might stand for a fictive "opening" period before January
  2015 and after December 2014.

- `2015-13` might stand for January 2016 in a company which is
  changing their fiscal year from "January-December" to "July-June".

Journal groups
==============

.. class:: JournalGroup

    .. attribute:: menu_group

    The name of another plugin

    For each journal group
    there will be a menu item in the main menu.

    If the journal group has a :attr:`menu_group <JournalGroup.menu_group>`,
    then journals are added to the menu of the named plugin, otherwise to the
    menu of the ledger plugin.


.. class:: JournalGroups

    The list of possible journal groups.

    This list is used to build the main menu.
    Journals whose :attr:`journal_group <Journal.journal_group>` is
    empty will not be available through the main user menu.
    See also :attr:`JournalGroup.menu_group`.

    The default configuration defines the following journal groups:

        For wages journals.

    .. attribute:: financial

        For financial journals (bank statements and cash reports)


.. class:: PeriodStates

    The list of possible states of an accounting period.

    .. attribute:: open

    .. attribute:: closed

Voucher types
=============

The ledger plugin defines a list of **voucher types**, a choicelist that is
populated by other plugins like :mod:`lino_xl.lib.vat`, :mod:`lino_xl.lib.sales`
or :mod:`lino_xl.lib.orders` who define some subclass of :class:`Voucher` and
then must "register" that model to be used by one or several voucher types.

Every :term:`journal` must have its voucher type, configured in the journal's
:attr:`voucher_type <lino_xl.lib.ledger.Journal.voucher_type>` field.  Several
journals may share a same voucher type.  The voucher type of a journal must not
change as long as the journal has at least one voucher.


.. class:: VoucherTypes

    The list of voucher types available in this application.

    Each item is an instances of :class:`VoucherType`.

    .. method:: get_for_model()
    .. method:: get_for_table()

.. class:: VoucherType

    Base class for all items of :class:`VoucherTypes`.

    The **voucher type** defines the database model used to store
    vouchers of this type (:attr:`model`).

    In more complex cases the :term:`application developer` can define more than
    one *voucher type* per model by providing alternative tables (views) for it.

    .. attribute:: model

        The database model used to store vouchers of this type.
        A subclass of :class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.models.Voucher``.

    .. attribute:: table_class

        Must be a table on :attr:`model` having :attr:`master_key` set to
        the :term:`journal`.



.. class:: VoucherState

    Base class for items of :class:`VoucherStates`.

    .. attribute:: is_editable

        Whether a voucher in this state is editable.


.. class:: VoucherStates

    The list of possible states of a voucher.

    In a default configuration, vouchers can be :attr:`draft`,
    :attr:`registered`, :attr:`cancelled` or :attr:`signed`.

    >>> rt.show(ledger.VoucherStates)

    ======= ============ ============ ==========
    <BLANKLINE>

    .. attribute:: draft

        *Draft* vouchers can be modified but are not yet visible as movements
        in the ledger.

    .. attribute:: registered

        *Registered* vouchers cannot be modified, but are visible as
        movements in the ledger.

    .. attribute:: cancelled

        *Cancelled* is similar to *Draft*, except that you cannot edit
        the fields. This is used for invoices which have been sent,
        but the customer signaled that they doen't agree. Instead of
        writing a credit nota, you can decide to just cancel the
        invoice.

    .. attribute:: signed

        The *Signed* state is similar to *registered*, but cannot
        usually be deregistered anymore. This state is not visible in
        the default configuration. In order to make it usable, you
        must define a custom workflow for :class:`VoucherStates`.



Model mixins
============


.. class:: SequencedVoucherItem

   A :class:`VoucherItem` which also inherits from
   :class:`lino.mixins.sequenced.Sequenced`.


.. class:: AccountVoucherItem


    Abstract base class for voucher items which point to an account.

    This is also a :class:`SequencedVoucherItem`.

    This is subclassed by
    :class:`lino_xl.lib.vat.models.InvoiceItem`
    and
    :class:`lino_xl.lib.vatless.models.InvoiceItem`.

    It defines the :attr:`account` field and some related methods.

    .. attribute:: account

        ForeignKey pointing to the account (:class:`ledger.Account
        <lino_xl.lib.ledger.Account>`) that is to be moved.



.. class:: VoucherItem

    Base class for items of a voucher.

    Subclasses must define the following fields:

    .. attribute:: voucher

        Pointer to the voucher which contains this item.  Non
        nullable.  The voucher must be a subclass of
        :class:`ledger.Voucher<lino_xl.lib.ledger.models.Voucher>`.
        The `related_name` must be `'items'`.


    .. attribute:: title

        The title of this voucher.

        Currently (because of :djangoticket:`19465`), this field is
        not implemented here but in the subclasses:

        :class:`lino_xl.lib.vat.models.AccountInvoice`
        :class:`lino_xl.lib.vat.models.InvoiceItem`


.. class:: Matching

    Model mixin for database objects that are considered *matching
    transactions*.  A **matching transaction** is a transaction that
    points to some other movement which it "clears" at least partially.

    A movement is cleared when its amount equals the sum of all
    matching movements.

    Adds a field :attr:`match` and a chooser for it.  Requires a field
    `partner`.  The default implementation of the chooser for
    :attr:`match` requires a `journal`.

    Base class for :class:`lino_xl.lib.vat.AccountInvoice`
    (and e.g. `lino_xl.lib.sales.Invoice`, `lino_xl.lib.finan.DocItem`)

    .. attribute:: match

       Pointer to the :class:`movement
       <lino.modlib.ledger.models.Movement>` which is being cleared by
       this movement.

.. class:: PartnerRelated

    Base class for things that are related to one and only one trade
    partner. This is base class for both (1) trade document vouchers
    (e.g. invoices or offers) and (2) for the individual entries of
    financial vouchers and ledger movements.

    .. attribute:: partner

        The recipient of this document. A pointer to
        :class:`lino_xl.lib.contacts.models.Partner`.

    .. attribute:: payment_term

        The payment terms to be used in this document.  A pointer to
        :class:`PaymentTerm`.

    .. attribute:: recipient

        Alias for the partner


.. class:: ProjectRelated

    Model mixin for objects that are related to a :attr:`project`.

    .. attribute:: project

        Pointer to the "project". This field exists only if the
        :attr:`project_model <Plugin.project_model>` setting is
        nonempty.

.. class:: Payable

    Model mixin for objects that represent a :term:`payable transaction`.

    Inherits from :class:`PartnerRelated`.

    .. attribute:: your_ref

    .. attribute:: due_date

    .. attribute:: payment_term

        See :attr:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.mixins.PartnerRelated.payment_term`

    .. attribute:: title

       A char field with a description for this transaction.

    .. method:: get_payable_sums_dict(self)

        To be implemented by subclasses.  Expected to return a dict which maps
        4-tuples `(acc_tuple, project, vat_class, vat_regime)` to the payable
        amount. `acc_tuple` is itself a tuple `(general_account,
        analytic_account)`, `vat_class` is a :class:`lino_xl.lib.vat.VatClasses`
        choice and `vat_regime` a :class:`lino_xl.lib.vat.VatRegimes` choice.

    .. method:: get_wanted_movements(self)

        Implements :meth:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.Voucher.get_wanted_movements`.


.. class:: PeriodRange

    Model mixin for objects that cover a range of :term:`accounting periods
    <accounting period>`.

    .. attribute:: start_period

       The first period of the range to cover.

    .. attribute:: end_period

       The last period of the range to cover.

       Leave empty if you want only one period (specified in
       :attr:`start_period`). If this is non-empty, all periods between and
       including these two are covered.

    .. method:: get_period_filter(self, voucher_prefix, **kwargs)


.. class:: PeriodRangeObservable

    Model mixin for objects that can be filtered by a range of :term:`accounting
    periods <accounting period>`. This adds two parameter fields
    :attr:`start_period` and :attr:`end_period` to every table on this model.

    Class attribute:

    .. attribute:: observable_period_field = 'accounting_period'

        The name of the database field on the observed model to use for
        filtering.


.. class:: ItemsByVoucher

    Shows the items of this voucher.

    This is used as base class for slave tables in
    :mod:`lino_xl.lib.finan`,
    :mod:`lino_xl.lib.vat`,
    :mod:`lino_xl.lib.vatless`,
    :mod:`lino_xl.lib.ana`, ...


.. _has_open_movements:

Filtering partners regarding ledger movements
=============================================

The ledger plugin adds a choice
:attr:`has_open_movements <lino_xl.lib.contacts.PartnerEvents.has_open_movements>`
to  the
:attr:`observed_events <lino_xl.lib.contacts.Partners.observed_events>`
parameter field
of the :class:`lino_xl.lib.contacts.Partners` table.

Show only companies that have at least one open ledger movement:

Utilities
=========

.. class:: DueMovement

    A volatile object representing a group of matching movements.

    A **due movement** is a movement which a partner should do in
    order to clear their debt.  Or which we should do in order to
    clear our debt towards a partner.

    The "matching" movements of a given movement are those whose
    `match`, `partner` and `account` fields have the same values.

    These movements are themselves grouped into "debts" and "payments".
    A "debt" increases the debt and a "payment" decreases it.

    .. attribute:: match

        The common `match` string of these movments

    .. attribute:: dc

        Whether I mean *my* debts and payments (towards that partner)
        or those *of the partner* (towards me).

    .. attribute:: partner

    .. attribute:: account


.. function:: get_due_movements(dc, flt)

    Generates a series of :class:`DueMovement` objects which --if they were
    booked-- would clear the movements given by the filter condition `flt`.

    There will be at most one :class:`DueMovement` per `(account, partner,
    project, match)`, each of them grouping the movements with same partner,
    account, project and match.

    This is the data source for :class:`ExpectedMovements` and subclasses.

    The balances of the :class:`DueMovement` objects will be positive or
    negative depending on the specified `dc`.

    Arguments:

    :dc: (boolean): The target booking direction, i.e. which direction should
         be considered positive. Open movements in the opposite direction will be
         negative.

    :flt: Optional filter arguments to give to Django's `filter()
          <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#filter>`_
          method in order to specifiy which :class:`Movement` objects
          to consider.

.. function:: check_clearings(qs, matches=[])

    Check whether involved movements are cleared or not, and update
    their :attr:`cleared` field accordingly.

.. function:: check_clearings_by_account(account, matches=[])

    Call :func:`check_clearings` for the given ledger account.

.. function:: check_clearings_by_partner(partner, matches=[])

    Call :func:`check_clearings` for the given partner.


Plugin attributes
=================

See :class:`lino_xl.lib.ledger.Plugin`.


Mixins
======

.. class:: AccountBalances

    A table which shows a list of general ledger accounts during the
    observed period, showing their old and new balances and the sum of
    debit and credit movements.



.. class:: AccountingPeriodRange

    A parameter panel with two fields:

    .. attribute:: start_period

        Start of observed period range.

    .. attribute:: end_period

        Optional end of observed period range.  Leave empty to
        consider only the Start period.



The Y2K problem
===============

Lino supports accounting across milleniums.

>>> FiscalYear = rt.models.ledger.FiscalYear
>>> print(FiscalYear.year2ref(1985))
1985
>>> print(FiscalYear.year2ref(9985))
9985


But there are legacy systems where the year was internally represented
using a two-letter code.

The
:attr:`fix_y2k <lino_xl.lib.ledger.Plugin.fix_y2k>` is either True or
False.



>>> dd.plugins.ledger.fix_y2k
False

>>> dd.plugins.ledger.fix_y2k = True
>>> print(FiscalYear.year2ref(1985))
85
>>> print(FiscalYear.year2ref(1999))
99
>>> print(FiscalYear.year2ref(2000))
A0
>>> print(FiscalYear.year2ref(2015))
B5
>>> print(FiscalYear.year2ref(2135))
N5
>>> print(FiscalYear.year2ref(2259))
Z9
>>> print(FiscalYear.year2ref(2260))

The `on_ledger_movement` signal
===============================

.. data:: on_ledger_movement

    Custom signal sent when a partner has had at least one change in a
    ledger movement.

    - `sender`   the database model
    - `instance` the partner

Don't read me
=============

Until 20181016 it was not possible to manually reverse the sort order
of a virtual field having a sortable_by which contained itself a
reversed field.  The :attr:`Movement.credit` field is an example:

>>> rmu(ledger.Movement.get_data_elem('credit').sortable_by)
['-amount', 'value_date']

>>> par = contacts.Partner.objects.get(pk=109)
>>> rt.show(ledger.MovementsByPartner, par, nosummary=True)

Templates
=========

.. xfile:: payment_reminder.body.html

  Defines the body text of a payment reminder.

.. xfile:: base.weasy.html
.. xfile:: payment_reminder.weasy.html

  Defines the body text of a payment reminder.


Generating counter-entries
==========================

A payment order generates counter entries

If you want Lino to suggest the cleaning of payment orders when entering bank
statements, then create  a  an organization (:class:`contacts.Company`)
representing your bank and have the :attr:`Journal.partner` field point to that
partner.

Note that the journal must also have an :attr:`account` with
:attr:`Account.needs_partner` enabled in order to prevent Lino from generating
detailed counter-entries (one per item). Clearing a payment order makes sense
only when the counter-entry is  the sum of all movements.
