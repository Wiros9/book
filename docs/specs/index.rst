Specs
=====

This section contains "functional specifications".

A **functional specification** is targeted at application developers,
consultants and trainers and ideally explains all technical and
functional aspects about a given plugin or topic.  If some part is
covered elsewhere, it should refer to these other documents.  It
should contain testable code snippets.
