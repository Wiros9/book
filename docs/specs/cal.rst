Glossary
=========

.. glossary::

  calendar entry

    A lapse of time to be visualized in a calendar.

    An instance of the :class:`Event` database model.

    A calendar entry usually has a given :term:`type <calendar entry type>`. It
    can have a list of guests or participants (more precisely :term:`presences
    <presence>`).

  calendar entry type

    The type of a :term:`calendar entry`.

    An instance of the :class:`EventType` database model.

    Often used calendar entry types are :term:`appointment`, informal meeting,
    public event, holiday.

  appointment

    A :term:`calendar entry` for which  other people (external partners or
    colleagues) are involved and should be informed about schedule changes.

    French: Rendez-vous, German: "Termin".

    Appointments are defined by assigning them a :term:`calendar entry type` that has
    the :attr:`EventType.is_appointment` field checked.

  all-day

    An **all-day** calendar entry is one that has no starting and ending time.

  same-day

    A **same-day** calendar entry is one that ends on the same date as it
    starts. The ending date field is empty. If a somae-day calendar entry  has
    its **ending time before the starting time**, the ending date is understood
    as the day after the starting date.

  presence

    The fact that a given person is an expected participant to a given
    :term:`calendar entry`.

  task

    Something a user plans to do.

  daily planner

    A table showing a calendar overview for a given day.  Both the rows and the
    columns can be configured per application or locally per site.

    See :class:`DailySlave`.

  My calendar entries

    A table showing today's and all future appointments of the user who requests
    it. It starts today and is sorted ascending.

  automatic calendar entry

    A :term:`calendar entry` that has been generated by a :term:`calendar
    generator`.

    The rules for generating automatic calendar entries are
    application-specific.  The :term:`application developer` does this by
    defining one or several :term:`calendar generators <calendar generator>`.

  calendar generator

    A database object that can generate a series of calendar entries.



Calendar entries
================


.. class:: Event

    The Django model which represents a :term:`calendar entry`.

    The internal model name is :class:`Event` for historical reasons. Users see
    it as "Calendar entry".

    >>> print(rt.models.cal.Event._meta.verbose_name)
    Calendar entry

    .. attribute:: start_date

        The starting date of this entry.  May not be empty.

    .. attribute:: end_date

        The ending date of this entry. Leave empty for :term:`same-day` entries.

    .. attribute:: start_time

        The starting time.  If this is empty, the entry is considered a
        :term:`all-day` entry.

        Changing this field will change the :attr:`end_time` field as well, if
        the entry's :term:`type <calendar entry type>` has a default duration
        (:attr:`EventType.default_duration`).

    .. attribute:: end_time

        The ending time.  If this is before the starting time, and no ending date
        is given, the entry ends the day after.

    .. attribute:: summary

         A one-line descriptive text.

    .. attribute:: description

         A longer descriptive text.

    .. attribute:: user

         The responsible user.

    .. attribute:: assigned_to

        Another user who is expected to take responsibility for this
        entry.

        See :attr:`lino.modlib.users.Assignable.assigned_to`.

    .. attribute:: event_type

        The type of this calendar entry.

        Every calendar entry should have this
        field pointing to a given :class:`EventType`, which holds
        extended configurable information about this entry.

    .. attribute:: state

        The state of this entry. The state can change according to
        rules defined by the workflow.

    .. attribute:: transparent

        Whether this entry should allow other entries at the same time.

    .. attribute:: when_html

         Shows the date and time of the entry with a link that opens
         all entries on that day.

         See :class:`EntriesByDay <lino_xl.lib.cal.EntriesByDay>`.

         Deprecated because it is usually irritating. Use when_text,
         and users open the detail window as usualy by double-clicking
         on the row. And then they have an action on each entry for
         opening EntriesByDay if they want.

    .. attribute:: show_conflicting

         A :class:`ShowSlaveTable <lino.core.actions.ShowSlaveTable>`
         button which opens the :class:`ConflictingEvents
         <lino_xl.lib.cal.ConflictingEvents>` table for this event.

    .. method:: update_guests

        Populate or update the list of participants for this calendar
        entry according to the suggestions.

        Calls :meth:`suggest_guests` to instantiate them.

        - No guests are added when loading from dump

        - The entry must be in a state which allows editing the guests

        - Deletes existing guests in state invited that are no longer
          suggested


    .. method:: update_events

        Create or update all other automatic calendar entries of this
        series.

    .. method:: show_today

    .. method:: get_conflicting_events(self)

        Return a QuerySet of calendar entries that conflict with this one.
        Must work also when called on an unsaved instance.
        May return None to indicate an empty queryset.
        Applications may override this to add specific conditions.

    .. method:: has_conflicting_events(self)

        Whether this entry has any conflicting entries.

        This is roughly equivalent to asking whether
        :meth:`get_conflicting_events()` returns more than 0 events.

        Except when this event's type tolerates more than one events
        at the same time.

    .. method:: suggest_guests(self)

        Yield the list of unsaved :class:`Guest` instances to be added
        to this calendar entry.

        This method is called from :meth:`update_guests`.

    .. method:: get_event_summary(self, ar)

        How this event should be summarized in contexts where possibly
        another user is looking (i.e. currently in invitations of
        guests, or in the extensible calendar panel).

    .. method:: before_ui_save(self, ar)

        Mark the entry as "user modified" by setting a default state.
        This is important because EventGenerators may not modify any
        user-modified Events.

    .. method:: auto_type_changed(self, ar)

        Called when the number of this automatically generated entry
        (:attr:`auto_type` ) has changed.

        The default updates the summary.


    .. method:: get_calendar(self)

        Returns the :class:`Calendar` which contains this entry, or
        None if no subscription is found.

        Needed for ext.ensible calendar panel.

        The default implementation returns None.
        Override this if your app uses Calendars.

Lifecycle of a calendar entry
=============================

Every calendar entry has a given **state** which can change according
to rules defined by the application.

The default list of choices for this field contains the following
values.

<BLANKLINE>


.. class:: EntryStates

    The list of possible states of a calendar entry.

.. class:: EntryState

    Every calendar entry state is an instance of this and has some attributes.

    .. attribute:: fill_guests

        Whether the presences of an entry in this state are filled in
        automatically.  If this is True (and if the entry type's
        :attr:`fill_presences` is True as well), the presences cannot be
        modified manually by the used.

        TODO: rename this to fill_presences

    .. attribute:: guest_state

        Force the given guest state for all guests when an entry is
        set to this state and when
        :attr:`EventType.force_guest_states` is True.

    .. attribute:: transparent

        Whether an entry in this state is considered transparent, i.e. dos not
        conflict with other entries at the same moment.

    .. attribute:: fixed

        Whether an entry in this state is considered "stable" when
        differentiating between "stable" and "pending" entries.

        This does not influence editability of the entry.

        See :attr:`EventEvents.stable` and :attr:`EventEvents.pending`.

    .. attribute:: noauto

        Whether switching to this state will clear the entry's :attr:`auto_type`
        field, i.e. it is no longer considered an automatically generated entry,
        IOW it "escapes" from its entry generator.

    .. attribute:: edit_guests

        Old name for :attr:`fill_guests`.


Calendar entry types
====================

Every calendar entry has a field :attr:`Event.event_type` which points to its
type.

There are different **types of calendar entries**. The list of *calendar entry
types* is configurable via :menuselection:`Configure --> Calendar --> Calendar
entry types`.  The type of a calendar entry can be used to change behaviour and
rules.


.. class:: EventType

    Django model representing a :term:`calendar entry type`.

    The possible value of the :attr:`Event.event_type` field.

    .. attribute:: default_duration

        An optional default duration for calendar entries of this type.

        If this field is set, Lino will help with entering
        :attr:`Event.end_time` and :attr:`Event.start_date` of an calendar
        entries by changing the :attr:`end_time` of an entry when the
        :attr:`start_date` is changed (and the :attr:`start_time` when the
        :attr:`end_date`)

    .. attribute:: event_label

        Default text for summary of new entries.

    .. attribute:: is_appointment

        Whether entries of this type are considered "appointments" (i.e. whose
        time and place have been agreed upon with other users or external
        parties).

        Certain tables show only entries whose type has the
        `is_appointment` field checked.  See :attr:`show_appointments
        <Entries.show_appointments>`.

    .. attribute:: max_days

        The maximal number of days allowed as duration. 0 means no limit.

        If this is 1, Lino will set :attr:`end_date` to `None`.

        See also :class:`LongEntryChecker`

    .. attribute:: locks_user

        Whether calendar entries of this type make the user
        unavailable for other locking events at the same time.

    .. attribute:: max_conflicting

        How many conflicting events should be tolerated.

    .. attribute:: transparent

        Allow entries of this type to conflict with other events.

    .. attribute:: force_guest_states

        Whether presence states should be forced to those defined by the
        entry state.

        This will have an effect only if the :term:`application developer`
        has defined a mapping from entry state to the guest state by
        setting :attr:`EntryState.guest_state` for at least one entry
        state.

        :ref:`tera` uses this for individual and family therapies
        where they don't want to manage presences of every
        participant.  When an appointment is set to "Took place", Lino
        sets all guests to "Present".  See :doc:`tera/cal` for a usage
        example.

    .. attribute:: fill_presences

        Whether guests should be automatically filled for calendar entries of
        this type.

    .. attribute:: fill_guests

        Planned name for :attr:`fill_presences`.


.. class:: EventTypes

    The list of entry types defined on this site.

    This is usually filled in the ``std`` demo fixture of the application.

    >>> rt.show(cal.EventTypes)

    =========== =============== ================== ================== ================ ============= ===================== =================
    <BLANKLINE>



Calendars
=========

Calendar entries can be grouped into "calendars".


.. class:: Calendar

    The django model representing a *calendar*.

    .. attribute:: color

        The color to use for entries of this calendar (in
        :mod:`lino_xl.lib.extensible`).


.. class:: Calendars

>>> rt.show(cal.Calendars)
==== ============= ================== ================== ============= =======
 ID   Designation   Designation (de)   Designation (fr)   Description   color
---- ------------- ------------------ ------------------ ------------- -------
 1    General       Allgemein          Général                          1
                                                                        **1**
==== ============= ================== ================== ============= =======
<BLANKLINE>


Note that the default implementation has no "Calendar" field per
calendar entry.  The `Event` model instead has a
:meth:`Event.get_calendar` method.

You might extend Event in your plugin as follows::

    from lino_xl.lib.cal.models import *
    class Event(Event):

        calendar = dd.ForeignKey('cal.Calendar')

        def get_calendar(self):
            return self.calendar

But in other cases it would create unnecessary complexity to add such
a field. For example in :ref:`welfare` there is one calendar per User,
and thus the `get_calendar` method is implemented as follows::

    def get_calendar(self):
        if self.user is not None:
            return self.user.calendar

Or in :ref:`voga` there is one calendar per Room. Thus the
`get_calendar` method is implemented as follows::

    def get_calendar(self):
        if self.room is not None:
            return self.room.calendar


.. _specs.cal.automatic_events:

Automatic calendar entries
==========================

An **event generator** is something that can generate automatic
calendar entries.  Examples of event generators include

- :doc:`Holidays <holidays>`

- A *course*, *workshop* or *activity* as used by Welfare, Voga and
  Avanti (subclasses of :class:`lino_xl.lib.courses.models.Course`).

- A reservation of a room in :ref:`voga`
  (:class:`lino_xl.lib.rooms.Reservation`).

- A coaching contract with a client in :ref:`welfare`
  (:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.isip.Contract` and
  :class:`lino_welfare.modlib.jobs.Contract`)

The main effect of the :class:`EventGenerator`
mixin is to add the :class:`UpdateEntries` action.

The event generator itself does not necessarily also contain all those
fields needed for specifying **which** events should be
generated. These fields are implemented by another mixin named
:class:`RecurrenceSet`. A
recurrence set is something that specifies which calendar events
should get generated.



.. class:: EventGenerator

    Base class for things that generate a series of events.

    See :ref:`specs.cal.automatic_events`.


    .. method:: update_all_guests

        Update the presence lists of all calendar events generated by
        this.

    .. method:: do_update_events

        Create or update the automatic calendar entries controlled by
        this generator.

        This is the :guilabel:` ⚡ ` button.

        See :class:`UpdateEntries`.

    .. method:: get_wanted_auto_events(self, ar)

        Return a tuple of two dicts of "wanted" and "unwanted" events.

        Both dicts map a sequence number to an Event instances.
        `wanted` holds events to be saved,
        `unwanted` holds events to be deleted.

        If an event has been manually moved to another date, all
        subsequent events adapt to the new rythm (except those which
        have themselves been manually modified).

    .. method:: care_about_conflicts(self, we)

        Whether this event generator should try to resolve conflicts
        (in :meth:`resolve_conflicts`)

    .. method:: resolve_conflicts(self, we, ar, rset, until)

        Check whether given entry `we` conflicts with other entries
        and move it to a new date if necessary. Returns (a) the
        entry's :attr:`start_date` if there is no conflict, (b) the
        next available alternative date if the entry conflicts with
        other existing entries and should be moved, or (c) None if
        there are conflicts but no alternative date could be found.

        `ar` is the action request who asks for this.  `rset` is the
        :class:`RecurrenceSet`.




.. class:: UpdateEntries

    Generate or update the automatic events controlled by this object.

    This action is installed as
    :attr:`EventGenerator.do_update_events`.

.. class:: UpdateEntriesByEvent

    Update all events of this series.

    This is installed as
    :attr:`update_events <Event.update_events>` on :class:`Event`.


The generated calendar entries are "controlled" by their generator
(their :attr:`owner <Event.owner>` field points to the generator) and
have a non-empty :attr:`Event.auto_type` field.


Recurrencies
============

The **recurrency** expresses how often something is to be repeated.

When generating automatic calendar events, Lino supports the following
date recurrenies:

>>> rt.show(cal.Recurrencies)
======= ============= ====================
 value   name          text
------- ------------- --------------------
 O       once          once
 D       daily         daily
 W       weekly        weekly
 M       monthly       monthly
 Y       yearly        yearly
 P       per_weekday   per weekday
 E       easter        Relative to Easter
======= ============= ====================
<BLANKLINE>


.. class:: Recurrencies

    List of possible choices for a 'recurrency' field.

    Note that a recurrency (an item of this choicelist) is also a
    :class:`DurationUnit`.

    .. attribute:: easter

        Repeat events yearly, moving them together with the Easter
        data of that year.

        Lino computes the offset (number of days) between this rule's
        :attr:`start_date` and the Easter date of that year, and
        generates subsequent events so that this offset remains the

Recurrent events
================

This plugin defines a database model :class:`RecurrentEvent
<lino_xl.lib.cal.RecurrentEvent>` used for example to generate holidays.  See
also :ref:`xl.specs.holidays`.

We are going to use this model for demonstrating some more features (which it
inherits from :class:`RecurrenceSet` and :class:`EventGenerator`).

Transparent calendar entries
============================

The entry type "Internal" is marked "transparent".

>>> obj = cal.EventType.objects.get(id=4)
>>> obj
EventType #4 ('Internal')
>>> obj.transparent
True


The guests of a calendar entry
==============================

A calendar entry can have a list of **guests** (also called presences or
participants depending on the context). A guest is the fact that a given person
is *expected to attend* or *has been present* at a given calendar entry.
Depending on the context the guests of a calendar entry may be labelled
"guests", "participants", "presences", ...


.. class:: Guest

    The Django model representing a guest.

    .. attribute:: event

        The calendar event to which this presence applies.

    .. attribute:: partner

        The partner to which this presence applies.

    .. attribute:: role

        The role of this partner in this presence.

    .. attribute:: state

        The state of this presence.  See :class:`GuestStates`.


    The following three fields are injected by the
    :mod:`reception <lino_xl.lib.reception>` plugin:

    .. attribute:: waiting_since

        Time when the visitor arrived (checked in).

    .. attribute:: busy_since

        Time when the visitor was received by agent.

    .. attribute:: gone_since

        Time when the visitor left (checked out).


Every participant of a calendar entry can have a "role". For example
in a class meeting you might want to differentiate between the teacher
and the pupils.

.. class:: GuestRole

    The role of a guest expresses what the partner is going to do there.

.. class:: GuestRoles

    Global table of guest roles.

.. class:: GuestStates

    Global choicelist of possible guest states.

    Possible values for the state of a participation. The list of
    choices for the :attr:`Guest.state` field.

    The actual content can be redefined by other plugins, e.g.
    :mod:`lino_xl.lib.reception`.


    >>> rt.show(cal.GuestStates)
    ======= ========= ============ ========= =============
     value   name      Afterwards   text      Button text
    ------- --------- ------------ --------- -------------

     40      present   Yes          Present   ☑
     50      missing   Yes          Missing   ☉
     60      excused   No           Excused   ⚕
    ======= ========= ============ ========= =============
    <BLANKLINE>


.. class:: UpdateGuests

    See :meth:`Event.update_guests`.


.. class:: UpdateAllGuests

    See :meth:`EventGenerator.update_all_guests`.


Presence lists
==============

To introduce the problem:

- :manage:`runserver` in :mod:`lino_book.projects.avanti1` and sign in as robin.
- create a calendar entry, leave it in draft mode
- Note that you cannot manually enter a guest in the presences list.

This is a situation where we want Lino to automatically keep the list of guests
synchronized with the "suggested guests" for this meeting.  For example in
:ref:`avanti` when we have a course with participants (enrolments), and we have
generated a series of calendar entries having their suggested guests filled
already, and now one participant cancels their enrolment.  We want Lino to
update all participants of meetings that are still in draft state.  The issue is
that Lino doesn't correctly differentiate between those two situations:

- manually enter and manage the list of guests

- fill guests automatically and keep it synchronized with the guests suggested
  by the entry generator.

Lino should not let me manually create a guest when the entry is in "fill
guests" mode.

The :attr:`Event.update_guests` action is always called in the
:meth:`Event.after_ui_save` method.  That's okay, but in our case the action
obviously comes to the conclusion that we do want to update our guests. More
precisely the event state obviously has :attr:`EntryState.edit_guests` set to
False, and the entry type has :attr:`fill_presences` set to True.  The solution
is to simply set

- The :meth:`Event.can_edit_guests_manually` method which encapsulates this
  condition.
- That method is now also used to decide whether the presences lists can be
  modified manually.

Note the difference between "guest" and "presence". The model name is currently
still :class:`cal.Guest`, but this should be renamed to :class:`cal.Presence`.
Because the "guest" is actually the field of a presence which points to the
person who is the guest.


Remote calendars
================

A **remote calendar** is a set of calendar entries stored on another server.
Lino periodically synchronized the local data from the remote server, and local
modifications will be sent back to the remote calendar.

The feature is not currently being used anywhere.

See also :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cal.management.commands.watch_calendars`.


.. class:: RemoteCalendar

    Django model for representing a remote calendar.


Rooms
=====

A **room** is location where calendar entries can happen.  For a given room you
can see the :class:`EntriesByRoom` that happened (or will happen) there.  A
room has a multilingual name which can be used in printouts.

Applications might change the user label for this model e.g. to "Team" (as done
in :ref:`presto`) if the application is not interested in physical rooms.



.. class:: Room

    Django model for representing a room.

    .. attribute:: name

        The designation of the room. This is not required to be unique.

    .. attribute:: display_color

        The color to use when displaying entries in this room in the calendar
        view.

        See :class:`DisplayColors`.


.. class:: Rooms

    Base class for all list of rooms.


.. class:: AllRooms

    Show a list of all rooms.


.. class:: RoomDetail

    The detail layout for :class:`Rooms` and subclasses.

Subscriptions
=============

A **suscription** is when a user subscribes to a calendar.
It corresponds to what the extensible CalendarPanel calls "Calendars"


.. class:: Subscription

    Django model for representing a subscription.

    :user: points to the author (recipient) of this subscription
    :other_user:

.. class:: Subscriptions
.. class:: SubscriptionsByUser
.. class:: SubscriptionsByCalendar

Tasks
=====

A task is when a user plans to do something (and optionally wants to get
reminded about it).


.. class:: Task

    Django model for representing a subscription.

    .. attribute:: priority

        How urgent this task is.

        Choicelist field pointing to :class:`lino_xl.lib.xl.Priorities`.

    .. attribute:: state

        The state of this Task. one of :class:`TaskStates`.

.. class:: TaskStates

    Possible values for the state of a :class:`Task`. The list of
    choices for the :attr:`Task.state` field.


.. class:: Tasks

    Global table of all tasks for all users.

.. class:: TasksByUser

    Shows the list of tasks for this user.

.. class:: MyTasks

    Shows my tasks whose start date is today or in the future.

Recurrent calendar entries
==========================

.. class:: EventPolicy

    A **recurrency policy** is a rule used for generating automatic
    calendar entries.

    .. attribute:: event_type

        Generated calendar entries will have this type.

.. class:: EventPolicies

    Global table of all possible recurrencly policies.

.. class:: RecurrentEvent

    A **recurring event** describes a series of recurrent calendar
    entries.

    .. attribute:: name

        See :attr:`lino.utils.mldbc.mixins.BabelNamed.name`.

    .. attribute:: every_unit

        Inherited from :attr:`RecurrentSet.every_unit
        <lino_xl.lib.cal.RecurrentSet.every_unit>`.

    .. attribute:: event_type


    .. attribute:: description

    .. method:: care_about_conflicts(self, we)

        Recurrent events don't care about conflicts. A holiday won't move
        just because some other event has been created before on that date.

.. class:: RecurrentEvents

    The list of all recurrent events (:class:`RecurrentEvent`).


Miscellaneous
==============

.. class:: Events

    Table which shows all calendar events.

    Filter parameters:

    .. attribute:: show_appointments

        Whether only *appointments* should be shown.  "Yes" means only
        appointments, "No" means no appointments and leaving it to
        blank shows both types of events.

        An appointment is an event whose *event type* has
        :attr:`appointment <EventType.appointment>` checked.

    .. attribute:: presence_guest

        Show only entries that have a presence for the specified guest.

    .. attribute:: project

        Show only entries assigned to this project, where project is defined by
        :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.project_model`.

    .. attribute:: assigned_to

        Show only entries assigned to this user.

    .. attribute:: observed_event

    .. attribute:: event_type

        Show only entries having this type.

    .. attribute:: state

        Show only entries having this state.

    .. attribute:: user

        Show only entries having this user as author.

.. class:: ConflictingEvents

    Shows events conflicting with this one (the master).

.. class:: EntriesByDay

    This table is usually labelled "Appointments today". It has no
    "date" column because it shows events of a given date.It is ordred
    with increasing times.

    The default filter parameters are set to show only *appointments*.

.. class:: EntriesByRoom

    Displays the calendar entries at a given :class:`Room`.

.. class:: EntriesByController

    Shows the calendar entries controlled by this database object.

    If the master is an :class:`EventGenerator
    <lino_xl.lib.cal.EventGenerator>`, then this includes
    especially the entries which were automatically generated.

.. class:: EntriesByProject

.. class:: OneEvent

    Show a single calendar event.

.. class:: MyEntries

    Table of appointments for which I am responsible.

    Table which shows today's and all future appointments of the
    requesting user.  The default filter parameters are set to show
    only appointments.

.. class:: MyEntriesToday

    Like :class:`MyEntries`, but only today.

.. class:: MyAssignedEvents

    The table of calendar entries which are *assigned* to me.  That
    is, whose :attr:`Event.assigned_to` field refers to the requesting
    user.

    This table also causes a :term:`welcome message` "X events have been
    assigned to you" in case it is not empty.

.. class:: OverdueAppointments

    Shows **overdue appointments**, i.e. appointments whose date is
    over but who are still in a nonstable state.

    :attr:`show_appointments` is set to "Yes", :attr:`observed_event`
    is set to "Unstable", :attr:`end_date` is set to today.

.. class:: MyOverdueAppointments

    Like OverdueAppointments, but only for myself.


.. class:: MyUnconfirmedAppointments

    Shows my appointments in the near future which are in suggested or
    draft state.

    Appointments before today are not shown.  The parameters
    :attr:`end_date` and :attr:`start_date` can manually be modified
    in the parameters panel.

    The state filter (draft or suggested) cannot be removed.


.. class:: Guests

    The default table of presences.

.. class:: GuestsByEvent

.. class:: GuestsByRole
.. class:: MyPresences

    Shows all my presences in calendar events, independently of their
    state.

.. class:: MyPendingPresences

    Received invitations waiting for my feedback (accept or reject).


.. class:: RecurrenceSet

    Mixin for models that express a set of repeating calendar events.
    See :ref:`specs.cal.automatic_events`.

    .. attribute:: start_date

        The start date of the first meeting to be generated.

    .. attribute:: end_date

        The end date of the first meeting to be generated.  Leave
        this field empty if the meetings last less than one day.

    .. attribute:: start_time
    .. attribute:: end_time

    .. attribute:: every

        The frequency of periodic iteration: daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.

    .. attribute:: every_unit

        The interval between each periodic iteration.

        For example, when :attr:`every` is yearly, an :attr:`every_unit` of 2
        means once every two years. The default value is 1.

    .. attribute:: positions

        Space-separated list of one or several positions within the recurrency
        cycle.

        Each position is a positive or negative integer expressing which
        occurrence is to be taken from the recurrency period. For example if
        :attr:`positions` is `-1` and :attr:`every_unit` is monthly, we get the
        last day of every month.

        Inspired by `dateutil.rrule <https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rrule.html>`_.

    .. attribute:: max_events

        Maximum number of calendar entries to generate.

    .. attribute:: monday
    .. attribute:: tuesday
    .. attribute:: wednesday
    .. attribute:: thursday
    .. attribute:: friday
    .. attribute:: saturday
    .. attribute:: sunday


    .. attribute:: weekdays_text

        A virtual field returning the textual formulation of the
        weekdays where the recurrence occurs.

        Usage examples see :ref:`book.specs.cal`.



.. class:: GuestsByPartner

    Show the calendar entries having this partner as a guest.

    This might get deprecated some day.  You probably prefer :class:`EntriesByGuest`.


.. class:: EntriesByGuest

    Show the calendar entries having this partner as a guest.

    Similar to :class:`GuestsByPartner`, but EntriesByGuest can be used to
    create a new calendar entry.  It also makes sure that the new entry has at
    least one guest, namely the partner who is the master. Because otherwise,
    if the user creates an entry and forgets to manually add our master as a
    guest, they would not see the new entry.



.. class:: Reservation

    Base class for :class:`lino_xl.lib.rooms.models.Booking` and
    :class:`lino.modlib.courses.models.Course`.

    Inherits from both :class:`EventGenerator` and :class:`RecurrenceSet`.

    .. attribute:: room

    .. attribute:: max_date

        Don't generate calendar entries beyond this date.

Display colors

.. data:: WORKDAYS

    The five workdays of the week (Monday to Friday).


Duration units
==============

The calendar plugin defines :class:`DurationUnits` choicelist, a
site-wide list of **duration units**.  In a default configuration it
has the following values:

>>> rt.show(cal.DurationUnits)
======= ========= =========
 value   name      text
------- --------- ---------
 s       seconds   seconds
 m       minutes   minutes
 h       hours     hours

 W       weeks     weeks
 M       months    months
 Y       years     years
======= ========= =========
<BLANKLINE>



.. class:: DurationUnits

    The list of possible duration units defined by this application.

    This is used as the selection list for the :attr:`duration_unit
    <Event.duration_unit`> field of a calendar entry.

    Every item is an instance of :class:`DurationUnit`.

.. class:: DurationUnit

    Base class for the choices in the :class:`DurationUnits`
    choicelist.

    .. method:: add_duration(unit, orig, value)

        Return a date or datetime obtained by adding `value`
        times this `unit` to the specified value `orig`.
        Returns None is `orig` is empty.

        This is intended for use as a `curried magic method` of a
        specified list item:




Duration units can be used for arithmetic operation on durations. For
example:

>>> from lino_xl.lib.cal.choicelists import DurationUnits
>>> start_date = i2d(20111026)
>>> DurationUnits.months.add_duration(start_date, 2)
datetime.date(2011, 12, 26)

>>> from lino.utils import i2d
>>> start_date = i2d(20111026)
>>> DurationUnits.months.add_duration(start_date, 2)
datetime.date(2011, 12, 26)
>>> DurationUnits.months.add_duration(start_date, -2)
datetime.date(2011, 8, 26)

>>> start_date = i2d(20110131)
>>> DurationUnits.months.add_duration(start_date, 1)
datetime.date(2011, 2, 28)
>>> DurationUnits.months.add_duration(start_date, -1)
datetime.date(2010, 12, 31)
>>> DurationUnits.months.add_duration(start_date, -2)
datetime.date(2010, 11, 30)

>>> start_date = i2d(20140401)
>>> DurationUnits.months.add_duration(start_date, 3)
datetime.date(2014, 7, 1)
>>> DurationUnits.years.add_duration(start_date, 1)
datetime.date(2015, 4, 1)


Miscellaneous
=============

.. class:: AccessClasses

    The sitewide list of access classes.

.. class:: ShowEntriesByDay

    Show all calendar events of the same day.


.. class:: Component

    Model mixin inherited by both :class:`Event` and :class:`Task`.

    .. attribute:: auto_type

        Contains the sequence number if this is an automatically
        generated component. Otherwise this field is empty.

        Automatically generated components behave differently at
        certain levels.


Plugin configuration
====================

See :class:`Plugin`.


Data checkers
=============

.. class:: ConflictingEventsChecker

    Check whether this entry conflicts with other events.

.. class:: ObsoleteEventTypeChecker

    Check whether the type of this calendar entry should be updated.

    This can happen when the configuration has changed and there are
    automatic entries which had been generated using the old
    configuration.

.. class:: LongEntryChecker

    Check for entries which last longer than the maximum number of
    days allowed by their type.

.. class:: EventGuestChecker

    Check for calendar entries without participants.

    :message:`No participants although N suggestions exist.` --
    This is probably due to some problem in the past, so we repair
    this by adding the suggested guests.





.. function:: check_subscription(user, calendar)

    Check whether the given subscription exists. If not, create it.


Default duration and start time
===============================

Note the difference between a DurationField and a TimeField:

>>> fld = cal.EventType._meta.get_field('default_duration')
>>> fld.__class__
<class 'lino.core.fields.DurationField'>
>>> fld.to_python("1:00")
Duration('1:00')

>>> fld = cal.Event._meta.get_field('start_time')
>>> fld.__class__
<class 'lino.core.fields.TimeField'>
>>> fld.to_python("1:00")
datetime.time(1, 0)

>>> et = cal.EventType.objects.get(planner_column=cal.PlannerColumns.internal)
>>> et.default_duration
Duration('0:30')

So when we create an entry which starts at 8:00, Lino will automaticallt set
end_time to 8:30

>>> entry = cal.Event(start_date=dd.today(), start_time="8:00", event_type=et)
>>> entry.full_clean()
>>> entry.end_time
datetime.time(8, 30)

It works also across midnight:

>>> entry = cal.Event(start_date=dd.today(), start_time="23:55", event_type=et)
>>> entry.full_clean()
>>> entry.start_time
datetime.time(23, 55)
>>> entry.end_time
datetime.time(0, 25)
>>> entry.start_date
datetime.date(2017, 2, 15)
>>> entry.end_date


User roles
==========

Besides the user roles defined in :mod:`lino.modlib.office` this plugins also
defines two specific roles.

.. class:: CalendarReader

    Can read public calendar entries. This is a kind of minimal
    calendar functionality that can be given to anonymous users,
    as done e.g. by :ref:`vilma`.

.. class:: GuestOperator

    Can see presences and guests of a calendar entry.

.. class:: GuestUser

    Can manage :term:`presences <presence>`.

    Usage example in :ref:`voga` where users of type `pupil` cannot create or
    edit calendar entries, but can manage their participation in existing
    entries.

Most calendar functionality requires
:class:`lino.modlib.office.OfficeUser`



positions
=========

The :attr:`RecurrenceSet.positions` field allows to specify rules like "every
last Friday of the month".

The following examples use a utility function:

>>> def show(obj, today):
...     for lng in ('en', 'de', 'fr'):
...         with translation.override(lng):
...             print(obj.weekdays_text)
...     for i in range(5):
...         x = obj.get_next_suggested_date(None, today)
...         print(dd.fdf(x))
...         today = x

Every last Friday of the month:

>>> obj = cal.RecurrentEvent()
>>> obj.friday = True
>>> obj.positions = "-1"
>>> obj.every_unit = cal.Recurrencies.monthly
>>> show(obj, i2d(20191001))
Every last Friday of the month
Jeden letzten Freitag des Monats
Chaque dernier Vendredi du mois
Friday, 25 October 2019
Friday, 29 November 2019
Friday, 27 December 2019
Friday, 31 January 2020
Friday, 28 February 2020

The first and third Wednesday of every month:

>>> obj = cal.RecurrentEvent(name="Test")
>>> obj.wednesday = True
>>> obj.positions = "1 3"
>>> obj.every_unit = cal.Recurrencies.monthly
>>> show(obj, i2d(20191001))
Every first and third Wednesday of the month
Jeden ersten und dritten Mittwoch des Monats
Chaque premier et troisième Mercredi du mois
Wednesday, 2 October 2019
Wednesday, 16 October 2019
Wednesday, 6 November 2019
Wednesday, 20 November 2019
Wednesday, 4 December 2019

>>> obj = cal.RecurrentEvent()
>>> obj.friday = True
>>> obj.monday = True
>>> obj.positions = "2"
>>> obj.every_unit = cal.Recurrencies.monthly
>>> show(obj, i2d(20191213))
Every second Monday and Friday of the month
Jeden zweiten Montag und Freitag des Monats

>>> obj.positions = "-2"
>>> obj.monday = False
>>> show(obj, i2d(20191213))
