Ch√¢telet
========

Is documented separately in :ref:`welcht`.

The courses, esf, art61 and immersion plugins are defined in
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib` but (currently) used only by :mod:`lino_welcht`.
That's why  the specs for these plugins are in the :ref:`welcht` doctree.  But
we want the source code of a plugin to refer to its specs.  This ref is needed
when building the API for welfare. Which is in book. But the docs of book
cannot refer to the docs of welcht because this would be a circular dependency.
We definitively want the welcht docs be able to refer to the book (don't we?).
So theoretically we should have a demo project in the book which uses these
plugins. But theory is not always the same as reality.  Maybe one day we start
a separate book for lino welfare... En attendant as a quick workaround we
define the following  wrapper pages here:

   art61
   esf
   immersion
   courses
