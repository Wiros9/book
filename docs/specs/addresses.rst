``addresses`` : Multiple addresses per partner
==============================================

.. currentmodule:: lino_xl.lib.addresses

The :mod:`lino_xl.lib.addresses` plugin adds functionality and models to handle
multiple addresses per :term:`partner`.  When this plugin is installed, your
application gets a "Manage addresses" button in the :attr:`overview` field of a
partner.  See also :ref:`team.mt.addresses`.

  address fields

    The database fields that make up a postal address. Here they are:

    >>> sorted(addresses.Address.ADDRESS_FIELDS)
    ['addr1', 'addr2', 'city', 'country', 'region', 'street', 'street_box', 'street_no', 'street_prefix', 'zip_code']

    Each partner object has these address fields, and each :term:`address
    record` has them.  The address fields of a partner always contain a copy of
    the partner's :term:`primary address`.

  address record

    One of possibly many addresses of a given partner.
    Stored using the :class:`Address` model.
    Implements :class:`lino.utils.addressable.Addressable`.

    Inherits fields from :class:`lino_xl.lib.countries.CountryRegionCity`
    (country, region, city. zip_code) and
    :class:`lino_xl.lib.contacts.AddresssLocation` (street, street_no, ...).

  primary address

    The address that is used as the primary address of a given partner.

.. _specs.addresses.AddressOwnerChecker:

Data check on addresses
=======================

The :class:`AddressOwnerChecker` detects inconsistencies between the address on
the owner (partner) and its collection of addresses.  Theoretically things are
easy: the partner's address fields contain a copy of the partner's primary
address.  But bugs and other circumstances can lead to inconsistencies. And when
you have thousands of addresses, you don't want to get bothered by problems that
might get fixed automatically. Quite sophisticated task though, because Lino
must not loose any data and must not "fix" problems for which actually a human
is needed.

.. class:: AddressOwnerChecker

    Checks for the data problems described below.

Here is a utility function used to describe and test the possible data problems
and how Lino handles them.  The remaining part of this section will call this
function over and over again.  For each test it creates a partner and a list of
addresses, then runs the data checker to detect problems, then prints the
problem message and a summary of the database content after fixing them before
cleaning up the database.  Most addresses have just a street name to simplify
things.

>>> from lino_xl.lib.contacts.utils import street2kw
>>> checker = rt.models.addresses.AddressOwnerChecker.self
>>> PK = 1234
>>> Partner = dd.plugins.addresses.partner_model
>>> Address = rt.models.addresses.Address
>>> def p(street="", **kwargs):
...     return Partner(pk=PK, name="x", **street2kw(street, **kwargs))
>>> def a(street="", primary=False, **kwargs):
...     return Address(primary=primary, **street2kw(street, **kwargs))
>>> def test(partner, *addresses):
...     # delete all db objects:
...     Address.objects.filter(partner_id=PK).delete()
...     Partner.objects.filter(id=PK).delete()
...     # store partner and addresses:
...     partner.save()
...     for a in addresses:
...         a.partner = partner
...         a.save()
...     for (fixable, msg) in checker.get_checkdata_problems(partner, fix=True):
...         print(("(*) " if fixable else "") + str(msg))
...     print(', '.join(Partner.objects.get(pk=PK).address_location_lines()))
...     for addr in Address.objects.filter(partner_id=PK):
...         print("- " + ("primary " if addr.primary else "") + ', '.join(addr.address_location_lines()))
...     Address.objects.filter(partner_id=PK).delete()
...     Partner.objects.filter(id=PK).delete()


>>> test(p("foo"))  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
(*) Primary address is missing.
foo
- primary foo

When the partner has some non-empty address field and there is no
:class:`Address` object that matches this address, Lino fixes this by creating
an address record from these.

>>> test(p("foo"), a("bar"))  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
(*) Primary address is missing.
foo
- bar
- primary foo

The :message:`Unique address is not marked primary.` means that  there is
exactly one :class:`Address` object which matches the partner and just fails to
be marked as primary, mark it as primary and return it.

>>> test(p("foo"), a("foo"))  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
(*) Unique address is not marked primary.
foo
- primary foo

Multiple primary addresses are not allowed.  If one of them matches the partner,
Lino can fix it by removing primary from the others:

>>> test(p("foo"), a("foo", True), a("bar", True))  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
(*) Multiple primary addresses.
foo
- primary foo
- bar

But if none of them matches the partner, Lino cannot fix the issue:

>>> test(p("foo"), a("bar", True), a("baz", True))  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
Multiple primary addresses.
foo
- primary bar
- primary baz


>>> test(p("foo"), a("bar", True))  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
Primary address differs from owner address (street:foo->bar).
foo
- primary bar

>>> test(p("foo"), a("", True))  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
(*) Must sync owner to address.
foo
- primary foo

When the only address is overwritable but not marked primary, Lino will set it
to primary.

>>> test(p("foo"), a(""))  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
(*) Must sync owner to address.
foo
- primary foo

Two addresses, but the wrong one is marked primary:

>>> test(p("foo"), a("bar", True), a("foo"))
(*) Matching address is not marked primary.
foo
- bar
- primary foo

When exactly one addresses matches the partner, it becomes primary and
potentially gets synchronized if it is incomplete.

>>> test(p("foo"), a("bar"), a("foo"))
(*) Matching address is not marked primary.
foo
- bar
- primary foo

>>> test(p("foo"), a("foo"), a("bar"))
(*) Matching address is not marked primary.
foo
- primary foo
- bar

When the address record just lacks some field, Lino can update it.

>>> test(p("foo", addr2="foo2"), a("foo"), a("bar"))
(*) Primary address is not complete
(*) Matching address is not marked primary.
foo, foo2
- primary foo, foo2
- bar

When no address record matches:

>>> test(p("foo"), a("bar"), a("baz"))
(*) Primary address is missing.
foo
- bar
- baz
- primary foo

When more than one address record matches:

>>> test(p("foo"), a("foo"), a("foo"))
No primary address, but matching addresses exist.
foo
- foo
- foo


The wrong address is marked as primary:

>>> test(p("foo"), a("foo"), a("bar"), a("baz", True))
(*) Matching address is not marked primary.
foo
- primary foo
- bar
- baz


When the partner's address is empty, we can have as many addresses as we want as
long as none of them is marked primary.
