2021
====

This is the 2021 :term:`change log` for :ref:`book`.
General information about how to read and maintain this document in :ref:`dev.changes`.

2021-01-03
==========

Fix :ticket:``. Add new item :attr:`vatless` to :class:`lino_xl.lib.vat.VatClasses`.

Fix :ticket:`3909`. After editing the entry_date of the last voucher of the
journal we don't want its number to increase.

2021-01-07
==========

Release to PyPI: Lino 21.1.1


2021-01-06
==========

Release to PyPI: :ref:`xl` 21.1.3.

Fix some bugs in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.finan` : The choicelist for
FinancialVoucherItem.match didn't respect the suggest_future_vouchers settings
and therefore always showed all matches, including those that happen in the
future and won't get satisfied. Visible result: you select one of these matches,
but Lino then sets the field to blank. After selecting a partner, Lino didn't
suggest anything (because amount was 0.00, not None).
FillSuggestionsToVoucherItem caused an additional item to be created.

Release to PyPI: :ref:`xl` 21.1.4 and Lino 21.1.0

Fix :ticket:`3917` (Lino forgets the journal after saving a bank statement).

2021-01-05
==========

Miscellaneous minor optimizations for entering bank statements.
:class:`finan.DatedFinancialVoucherItem` now also fills the date field from
last_item_date. Trying to fix surprizing behaviour after
:class:`FillSuggestionsToVoucherItem`. Ledger movements in
:class:`ledger.MovementsByVoucher` are now ordered by :attr:`seqno`, i.e. by
their "natural" order of creation.

Fix a typo bug in lino_xl.lib.cal that caused Lino to no show anything in
cal.EntriesByGuest although the person was present in some calendar entry.

2021-01-02
==========

Fix :ticket:`3906` (active_fields are disturbing for city and zip_code). In
:class:`lino_xl.lib.countries.CountryCity` the fields city and zip_code are no
longer :attr:`active_fields <lino.core.model.Model.active_fields>`.

Fix :ticket:`3905` (Purchase invoice from private person suggests VAT). This
was a bug in :mod:`lino_xl.lib.eevat` and :mod:`lino_xl.lib.bevat`.

Fix :ticket:`3907` (Cannot enter into "Expense" column of bank statement)

Release to PyPI: :ref:`xl` (2 versions)


2021-01-01
==========

Optimized column layout of :class:`lino_xl.lib.sales.InvoicesByJournal`.

Release to PyPI: :ref:`xl`.
