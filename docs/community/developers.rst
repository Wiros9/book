Developers
==========

The **Lino developers** are those guys who know the Python programming
language and invest their time into Lino.

- **Experienced** developers are especially welcome. Lino is currently
  growing from a beast developed by a single developer into a
  community project. We need experienced people who dare to discuss
  with Luc about project management and development workflow.
  
- **Beginners** are equally welcome.  They have :doc:`their own page
  </team/newbies>`.  We help you to learn how to write your own Lino
  application.  Your advantage is that you get a free mentorship and
  increase your chances on the job market.

We can also differentiate developers by their *primary motivation*:

- **Core developers** help us to make Lino better.  This includes the
  core of the framework itself, the :ref:`xl` and the
  :ref:`lino.apps`.

- **Application developers** write their own independent Lino
  applications and publish them using their preferred license.

Developers can be **voluntary** contributors, independant
**freelancers** or **employed** by some company.  Currently `Rumma &
Ko is hiring <http://www.saffre-rumma.net/jobs/coredev>`__.  There
might be other companies offering Lino development.
