The **Lino developers** are those guys who know the Python programming
language. Lino needs both experienced developers and beginners.

- We need **experienced** Python developers who dare to discuss with
  Luc about project management and development workflow. Lino is
  constantly growing from a beast developed by a single developer into
  a community project.
  
- **Beginners** have :doc:`their own page </team/newbies>`.  We help
  you to learn how to write your own Lino application.  You get a free
  mentorship and increase your chances on the job market.

We can also differentiate developers by their *primary motivation*:

- **Core developers** help us to make Lino better.  This includes the
  core of the framework itself, the :ref:`xl` and the
  :ref:`lino.apps`.

- **Application developers** write their own independent Lino
  applications and publish them using their preferred license.

Developers can be **voluntary** contributors, independant
**freelancers** or **employed** by some company.  Currently `Rumma &
Ko is hiring <http://www.saffre-rumma.net/jobs/coredev>`__.  There
might be other companies offering Lino development.
