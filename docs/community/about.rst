About the Lino community
========================

The **Lino community** is the group of people and organisations who use the
Lino framework as end users, developers or hosters.

It is currently led by Luc Saffre as a kind of de facto BDFL. Luc is paid by
:doc:`rumma` who get most of their income from Lino.

All work on Lino is published as free software under a BSD license. The
copyright holder for Lino, the legal entity and official address of the Lino
community is :doc:`rumma` as long as there is no :doc:`lsf`.
