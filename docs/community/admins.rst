System administrators
=====================

A **Lino system administrator** is a person who installs Lino
applications in order to make them available on a web server.  They
take care of the maintenance and security of those servers. They might
do this either in a single company as their system administrator or
for a :doc:`hosting provider </community/hosters>`.  The
:doc:`/admin/index` is their reference documentation.

Typical requirements for a Lino system administrator are:

- Lino is written in Python. You don't need profound knowledge of the
  language, but you are going to install Python packages (using `pip
  <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__ into virtual environments (using
  `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/index.html>`__).

- Previous experience with hosting `Django
  <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ applications is useful.
