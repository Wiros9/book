Making money with Lino
======================

This document describes the lifetime of a Lino project and how :doc:`rumma` use
Lino to make money.

Interview
=========

One of our developers has an **interview** with the customer candidate in order
to check whether their problem is something for Lino.

One aspect is the technical side: whether a Lino style application makes
sense, whether I am able to write it for them.

Another aspect is the financial side: We may decide to work for free during a
learning phase.

During the first 15 years we worked successfully by offering fixed yearly
flat-rate contracts: the customer pays a given sum per year and for this they
get our unlimited support.  The only limit are our human resources.  We promise
to our flat-rate customers that we give our best (but not more) to help them
with any problem.

Since 2016 we also offer per-hour service where the customer pays for every
minute of our time (including support, analysis, code changes, write
documentation).

We also require our bigger customers to have a single contact person who will
be responsible for training the end-users and for doing analysis.  In bigger
companies this can quickly become a full-time job i√≥n its own.

Offer and prototype
===================

If we have the feeling that they need a Lino, we write an offer and a prototype
for them. They don't need to pay for this.  The prototype is part of our
marketing work.  It is easier and more efficient to write a prototype than to
write a full analysis.
