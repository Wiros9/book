=============

Here are some profiles of people we happily welcome.

Individuals:

- **Python developers** -- consider whether Lino is the right tool
  for one of your projects. See :doc:`developers`.

- **System administrators** -- consider installing a Lino application
  for your employer. See :doc:`admins`.
  
- **Everybody** -- consider learning one or several Lino applications
  in order to help as a consultant, trainer or analyst.

Organizations:

- **IT solution providers** -- Consider becoming a
  Lino representative.  Tell other people about Lino.  Show the
  :ref:`demos` to other people and help them analyze whether they need
  a Lino application.
  Set up your own demo server.
  We help you with planning your projects.
  
- **Internet hosting providers** -- Consider becoming a :doc:`Lino
  Lino hosting provider and contact us to get listed in
  our :doc:`directory <hosters>`.

- **Software houses** -- Consider adding Lino to your portfolio of
  technologies.  If you already have Django experience, your learning effort will
  be small.

Vocabulary
==========

An **end user** is a human who uses a given *Lino site* for their daily work.
As a Lino end user you should know how to contact your *support provider*.

A **support provider** is somebody who helps end users if they have a question.
The support provider is always available when end users need them. If they
cannot help directly, then they know how to ask other actors.

A **Lino site** is when a given Lino application runs on a server so that its
end users can access it.

A **site administrator** is a human responsible for managing a site via its web
interface. They create accounts for end users and can change configuration
settings.

A **site owner** is an organization who decides to run a *Lino site*.  the site
owner is responsible to data protection and granting or revoking access
permissions to individual end users.

A **consultant** is somebody who knows the possibilities and limitations of the
Lino framework and helps you with analyzing your needs. They can give you
professional advice about whether or not to choose Lino as a solution.

A **hoster** is somebody who sets up a server with a Lino site and who helps
users to connect to that server.
A **hosting provider** does the same, but as a third-party company and not as
employee of the site owner. See the :doc:`Administrator's Guide
</admin/index>`.

An **application developer** is somebody who writes or maintains Lino
applications.  A **core developer** is somebody who writes or
maintains general core features of the Lino framework.
 
An **analyst** is somebody who collaborates with users in order to
analyze their needs, and who then explains to the *application
developer* how to make the application better (or how to make it at
all, in case of new development projects).

A **trainer** is somebody who can explain a given Lino application to
its users. Trainers also write documentation for users.
