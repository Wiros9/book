Vocabulary
==========

A **user** is somebody who uses a given *Lino site* for their daily
work.  As a Lino user you should know how to contact your *support
provider*.

A **Lino site** is when a given Lino application runs on an Internet
server so that its users can access it.  A **site owner** is somebody
who decides to run a *Lino site*.

A **support provider** is somebody who helps users if they have a
question. The support provider is always available when users need
them.  If they cannot help directly, then they know how to ask either
the *system administrator* or the *application developer*.

A **consultant** is somebody who knows the possibilities and
limitations of the Lino framework and helps you with analyzing your
needs. They can give you professional advice about whether or not to
choose Lino as a solution.

A **system administrator** is somebody who sets up a server with a
*Lino site* and who helps users to connect to that server.  A
**hosting provider** does the same, but as a third-party company and
not as employee of the site owner. See the :doc:`Administrator's Guide
</admin/index>`.

An **application developer** is somebody who writes or maintains Lino
applications.  A **core developer** is somebody who writes or
maintains general core features of the Lino framework.
 
An **analyst** is somebody who collaborates with users in order to
analyze their needs, and who then explains to the *application
developer* how to make the application better (or how to make it at
all, in case of new development projects).

A **trainer** is somebody who can explain a given Lino application to
its users. Trainers also write documentation for users.
