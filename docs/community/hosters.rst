Lino hosting providers
======================

A **Lino hosting provider** is a company able to set up and maintain a
web server where your Lino application will be running.  They assume
the following responsibilities:

- they care about reliability and make sure that your Lino is always
  available to respond when you need it.
  
- they care about security and protect your system against hackers
  
- they make backups of your data to make sure it doesn't get lost in
  case of a serious accident.
  
- they care about scaling. As your site will grow in terms of number
  of users and the amount of data stored, you might want to move to a
  bigger machine.
  
There are two types of hosting:
  
- in case of **development hosting** the hoster is *not reponsible*
  for *end-user support* and *regular maintenance*.  You need a second
  agreement with a :doc:`developer <developers>` for these.
       
- in case of **stable hosting** the hoster also offers these services,
  i.e. they answer your questions about how to use or configure the
  software, and they are able upgrade your site when new versions of the
  software are available.
