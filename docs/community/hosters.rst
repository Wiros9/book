Lino hosting providers
======================

A **Lino hosting provider** is a company able to set up and maintain a
web server where your Lino application will be running.  They care
about reliability and make sure that your Lino is always available to
respond when you need it. They care about security and protect your
system against hackers. They make backups of your data to make sure it
doesn't get lost in case of a serious accident.  They care about
scaling. As your site will grow in terms of number of users and the
amount of data stored, you might want to move to a bigger machine.

for becoming a "certified" Lino hoster.  It's all a question of trust.

ability to give professsional advice about whether a Lino solution can
make sense in a given context, and a potential ability to become a
qualified hosting provider when needed.  See also the :doc:`Hoster's
