There was a problem with the database connection
================================================

Lino tells me that "There was a problem with the database
connection. If the error persists, try reloading your browser."

What does that mean?

- Just hit :kbd:`Shift+Ctrl+R` and try again.  Lino might ask you to
  re-enter your username and password. This is usual e.g. after
  maintenance operations on the server.
  
  See `xkcd <https://xkcd.com/1854/>`__ for more options.
  
- Check the address field of your browser. This should show the URL
  where your Lino is installed, i.e. something like http://lino:8080
  or https://lino.example.com. If it isn't, click the
  :menuselection:`Home` menu button of the Lino main menu.
