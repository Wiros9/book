The Lino team is currently inviting companies all over the world to
join our community and get listed in our :doc:`directory
</community/hosters>` of recommented Lino hosting providers.

The condition for getting listed in that directory is a visible
interest in Lino and a potential ability to become a qualified
hosting provider when needed.
