Managing users via the web interface
====================================

You can add new users and edit existing users via the :menuselection:`Configure
--> System --> Users` menu. To see this menu command, you must have signed in as
a :term:`site administrator`, i.e. the :attr:`user_type
<lino.modlib.users.User.user_type>` field in your preferences must point to a
:term:`user type` that has the :class:`SiteAdmin` role.
