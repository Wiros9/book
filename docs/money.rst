How to make money with Lino
===========================

Here is how you can make money with Lino. In the following, "we" means the
:ref:`lsf`.

We provide all our services for free. You just need to ask. OTOH we can provide
these services only as much as our human resources permit.  You have no warranty
of getting a quick answer.

When you start earning enough money, we may decide to enter into a more binding
collaboration with a Service Level Agreement. You will start paying us e.g.
using a reasonable percentage of your benefit.

Business model A
================

As a combined :term:`hosting provider` and :term:`end-user support` provider.

The first part of what you are going to sell : hosting service, system maintenance.
The second part of what you are going to sell : end-user support and training.


Phase 1 (acquiring knowledge and sales)

- You learn a few existing Lino applications : what they can do, how to use
  them.
  We give you free support.
  We keep our demo servers up to date.

- You find a potential customer, i.e. a company who might want one of these
  applications.
  We might give you advice, but that's basically your job.


Phase 2 (first project)

- You order a VPS at a data center and learn how to configure a Lino server.
  You must learn about Linux system administration, how to monitor a server and
  keep it running, how to make backups.

  For each of your future customers you will have one VPS.
  You must also register at least one domain name.

  We give you support for this.
  We can recommend proven data centers:

  - OVH : https://www.ovh.ie/order/vps   3€/month
  - Hetzner : https://www.hetzner.com/cloud  2.89€/month


Phase 3 (training, support, analysis)

- You give training and support to your customer so that they can use their Lino
  site.

- Your customer will have change requests. You report them to us, we make code
  changes in the public version for free, you test them and then pull the new
  version to your customer's site and care for data migration.


- Optionally you can leave Phase 2 to us in the beginning. You would do "only"
  sales, support and analysis. But I would like to get some monthly
  payment then, at least 100€/month per site.
