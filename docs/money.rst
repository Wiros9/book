How to make money with Lino
===========================

Here is how you can make money with Lino. In the following, "we" means the
:ref:`lsf`.

We provide all our services for free. You just need to ask. OTOH we can provide
these services only as much as our human resources permit.  You have no warranty
of getting a quick answer.

When you start earning enough money, we may decide to enter into a more binding
collaboration with a Service Level Agreement. But nothing will force you to pay
us money us because both source code and documentation is freely available.
Anyway we are not yet there. Let's first imagine some ways of how you can make
your own money with Lino.

Business model A
================

As a combined :term:`hosting provider` and :term:`end-user support` provider.

The first part of what you are going to sell : hosting service, system maintenance.
The second part of what you are going to sell : end-user support and training.

Phase 1 (acquiring knowledge and sales)

- You learn a few existing Lino applications : what they can do, how to use
  them.
  We give you free support.
  We keep our demo servers up to date.

- You find a potential customer, i.e. a company who might want one of these
  applications.
  That's basically your job (though we might give you advice).


Phase 2 (your first production site)

- You order a VPS at a data center and learn how to configure a :term:`Lino
  server`. You must learn about Linux system administration, how to monitor a
  server and keep it running, how to make backups.

  For each of your future customers you will have one VPS.
  You must also register at least one domain name.

  We give you support for this.
  We can recommend proven data centers:

  - OVH : https://www.ovh.ie/order/vps   3€/month
  - Hetzner : https://www.hetzner.com/cloud  2.89€/month

- Optionally you can leave Phase 2 to us in the beginning. You would do "only"
  sales, support and analysis. But we would need some kind of Service Level
  Agreement then.

Phase 3 (training, support, analysis)

- You give training and support to your customer so that they can use their Lino
  site.

- Your customer will have change requests. You report them to us, we make code
  changes in the public version for free, you test them and then pull the new
  version to your customer's site and care for data migration.
