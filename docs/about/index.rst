About Lino
==========

**Lino** is a framework for developing customized database applications.

A **database application** is a computer program used for entering and
retrieving information from a database.  A **customized** database application
is one which is tailor-made to your needs.  A **framework** means that Lino is
**used by developers** who write and maintain applications for their employer
or their customers.

Primary **target users** of Lino applications are organizations who need a
customized application but do not have their own in-house developer.

Is Lino a full stack framework?

The Lino framework is rather encompassing in that it does not only cover
**back-end** technology(server, application, database),
and **front-end** technology (JavaScript, ExtJS, React),
but also **documentation technology** (Sphinx)
and even **marketing models**.

The advantage of Lino versus other frameworks is a reduced total cost of
ownership. Most parts of a *development project** become easier and cheaper for
the product owner. This includes analysis, writing a prototype, adapting your
application to changed needs and long-term maintenance. Lino applications are
"more reliable and maintainable than MS-Access for cheaper than SAP".

Typical Lino applications have a rather **complex database
structure**.  For example Lino Welfare has 155 models in 65 plugins.
Even Lino Noi (the smallest Lino application which is being used on a
production site) has 44 models in 32 plugins.

Lino uses technologies like
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`__,
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__
`React <https://reactjs.org/>`__,
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__ and
`Sencha ExtJS <https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`__.




A growing collection of maintained real-world applications can be
used by **service providers** who offer professional hosting of one of
these applications.
