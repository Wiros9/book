About Lino
==========

**Lino** is a framework for developing customized database applications based
on FOSS technologies like `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__, `Django
<https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ `React <https://reactjs.org/>`__, `Sencha
ExtJS <https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`__ and `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__.


A **database application** is a computer program used for entering and
retrieving information from a database.  A **customized** database application
is one which is tailor-made to your needs.  A **framework** means that Lino is
**used by developers** who write and maintain applications for their employer
or their customers.

Primary **target users** of Lino applications are organizations who need a
customized application and do not have their own in-house developer.

The Lino framework is more encompassing than a
`full stack framework <https://wsvincent.com/is-django-a-full-stack-framework/>`__
in that besides
**back-end** (server, application, database) and **front-end**
(JavaScript, ExtJS, React) technologies it
also addresses **documentation technology** (Sphinx)
and even **marketing models** (documented in our `Community Guide
<http://community.lino-framework.org/>`__).

The advantage of Lino versus other frameworks is a **reduced total cost of
ownership**. Most parts of a *development project* become easier and cheaper for
the product owner. This includes analysis, writing a prototype, adapting your
application to changed needs and long-term maintenance. Lino applications are
"more reliable and maintainable than MS-Access for cheaper than SAP".

Typical Lino applications have a rather **complex database
structure**.  For example Lino Welfare has 155 models in 65 plugins.
Even Lino Noi (the smallest Lino application which is being used on a
production site) has 44 models in 32 plugins.



A growing collection of maintained real-world applications can be
used by **service providers** who offer professional hosting of one of
these applications.
