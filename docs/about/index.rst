About Lino
==========

**Lino** is a framework for developing customized database applications without
getting locked into a proprietary vendor.

A **database application** is a computer program used for entering and
retrieving information from a database.  A **customized** database application
is one which is tailor-made to your needs.  A **framework** means that Lino is
used by developers who write and maintain applications for their employer or
their customers.

The Lino framework is based on FOSS technologies like `Python
<https://www.python.org/>`__, `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__
`React <https://reactjs.org/>`__, `Sencha ExtJS
<https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`__ and `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__.

The Lino framework is **encompassing** because besides
**back-end** (server, application, database) and **front-end**
(JavaScript, ExtJS, React) technologies, it
also provides a **documentation framework**
and even **marketing models** (documented in our `Community Guide
<http://community.lino-framework.org/>`__).

Typical Lino applications have a rather **complex database
structure**.  For example Lino Welfare has 155 models in 65 plugins.
Even Lino Noi (the smallest Lino application which is being used on a
production site) has 44 models in 32 plugins.

A growing collection of maintained real-world applications can be
used by **service providers** who offer professional hosting of one of
these applications.
