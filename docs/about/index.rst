About Lino
==========

**Lino** is a high-level framework based on
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
and `Sencha ExtJS
<https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`_,
used for writing customized database applications.

A **database application** is a computer program used for entering and
retrieving information from a database.  A **customized** database
application is one which is taylored to your needs.  A **framework**
means that Lino is designed to be **used by professional** developers
who write and maintain applications for their employer or their
customers.

Primary **target users** of Lino applications are organizations who need a
customized database application but to not have their own inhouse developer
team. The advantage of Lino versus other frameworks is a reduced total cost of
ownership. Most parts of a *development project** become easier and cheaper for
the product owner. This includes analysis, writing a prototype, adapting your
application to changed needs and long-term maintenance. Lino applications are
"more reliable and maintainable than MS-Access for cheaper than SAP".

Typical Lino applications have a rather **complex database
structure**.  For example Lino Welfare has 155 models in 65 plugins.
Even Lino Noi (the smallest Lino application which is being used on a
production site) has 44 models in 32 plugins.

A growing collection of maintained real-world applications can be
used by **service providers** who offer professional hosting of one of
these applications.
