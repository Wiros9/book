Limitations
===========

Lino is not for you, if...

- you just want a cheap, quick and dirty website with dynamic content
- you don't want to spend your time into developing a new software
- you want a cool website featuring the latest web technologies
- you don't plan to maintain your application

Lino applications *don't even try* to be "sexy". They are optimized
for people who get a few hours of training before they start using it
and who will use it for their everyday work. With Lino it takes a few
hours before an end user starts loving it, but that love
will --hopefully-- be deeper and last longer.

Lino as a framework :doc:`does not even try <not_easy>` to be easy to
learn. This is a design choice, not a limitation.  You need an
experienced Python developer for creating new Lino applications.  Yes,
such people tend to be expensive these days (Python was second after
Java in 2016, according to `Highest Paying Programming Languages In
2016
<http://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/15-highest-paying-programming-languages-2016-01559832#ueRWocGwdOXtxpL4.97>`_)
  
Lino is currently optimized for writing **desktop-like** applications,
i.e.  for being used from a *desktop* computer.  To make a Lino
application usable from **mobile devices** you must design and write
your own user interface. Or you can wait until we finished working on
a generic solution.
