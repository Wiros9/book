Why Lino
========

Lino is for you, if...

- you have a concrete need for a customized database application
- you want a stable and sustainable solution
- you are ready to invest also of your time for analysis and testing
- you want to keep control over your data even when your relationship
  with a given software provider breaks.
- you agree that the software created by our common efforts is being
  published as open source under a free license and can be used by
  others.

Some of Lino's design goals

- Lino applications are intuitive and easy to understand for the end user.
  (see :doc:`values`)
- Lino applications are easy to maintain because Lino encourages
  sustainable application development.
- agile programming
- rapid prototyping 
- libraries of reusable code
- short release cycles
- stable

What Lino is not:

- Lino applications don't try to be **sexy**. They are optimized for
  people who get a few hours of training before they start using it
  and who will use it for their everyday work. With Lino it takes a
  few hours before an end user starts loving it, but that love
  will --hopefully-- be deeper and last longer.

- Lino as a framework :doc:`does not even try <not_easy>` to be easy
  to learn. This is a design choice, not a limitation.  See also
  :doc:`think_python`.  You need an experienced Python developer for
  creating new Lino applications.  Yes, such people tend to be
  expensive these days (Python was second after Java in 2016,
  according to `Highest Paying Programming Languages In 2016
  <http://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/15-highest-paying-programming-languages-2016-01559832#ueRWocGwdOXtxpL4.97>`_).
  
- Lino is currently optimized for writing applications that are used
  from desktop computers.  To make them usable from **mobile devices**
  you must write your own user interface. Or you can wait until we
  finished working on a generic solution.

- Lino is not yet well documented. This is a price of having a small
  community. But our community is growing and we are working on it.
  Our goal is that every interested reader finds answers to their
  questions about Lino.  You can help us by sending your feedback,
  tell us where you got stuck, help us to make it easier for others to
  get started with Lino!

  


Lino is not for you, if...

- you just want a quick and dirty website with dynamic content
- you don't want to spend your time into developing a new software
- you want a cool website featuring the latest web technologies
- you don't plan to maintain your application
