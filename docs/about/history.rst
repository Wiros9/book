History
=======

Luc Saffre, the author of Lino, is also the author of :term:`TIM`, a
DOS-based framework for writing database applications for small
enterprises.  Lino is a successor for TIM.  TIM is over 20 years old,
but Luc continues to live from maintaining it and giving professional
support to its users.  TIM users have relatively wide-spread profiles,
ranging from the independant craftsman who writes 50 invoices per year
to the government agency with 30 users and hundreds of documents per
day.

Luc has been working on writing a successor for TIM **since the early
1990s**.  He has done and dropped projects in C++, PHP and Java.  In
`August 2013 <https://sourceforge.net/p/lino/news/>`_ he published a
first version of Lino on Sourceforge.

Since **August 2004** he's mostly working in Python. 
In **March 2009** he discovered :term:`Django` whose database model and application 
server concepts seem ideal for Lino. 
In **August 2009** he started to use the :term:`ExtJS` Javascript framework.

The first real-world Lino application started in a Belgian *Public
Centre for Social Welfare* (PCSW) in **January 2011**.  In **August
2012** we forked it into a separate project :ref:`welfare` in order to
make it maintainable by an independant organization.

In **September 2012** we registered the domain name
`lino-framework.org`.

The second real-world Lino application started :doc:`in Czechia <joe>`
in **July 2013**.

In **March 2014** we started the third Lino production site,
a second :ref:`welfare`.

`Hamza Khchine <https://github.com/khchine5>`__ started working for
Lino as a freelancer in **December 2015**.

The :ref:`voga` project started in **January 2016**, thanks to Alexa
who worked as a volunteer analyst almost full-time during eight
months.

From **April to November 2016**, Annalisa and Johannes gave much of
their time for the :ref:`care` project.

From **January to May 2017**, Tanel worked for Lino as project manager
for :ref:`vilma`.

In **February 2017** `Tonis <https://github.com/CylonOven>`__ started
working for Lino as the second full-time core developer.

In **December 2016** we started the :ref:`avanti` project.
  
In **May 2017** we started to work on :ref:`tera`.
