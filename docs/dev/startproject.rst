==================================
Starting your own Lino application
==================================

There is no :manage:`startproject` command for Lino because such a
command would have to ask quite complex questions.

If you are in a rush, try to follow the instructions in the README of
the `algus <https://github.com/lino-framework/algus>`_ project.  This
is probably the most close equivalent of Django's
:manage:`startproject` command.

But actually we recommend that you placidly read the :doc:`overview`
and :doc:`diving` sections before starting your own Lino application.
