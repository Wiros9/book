How to write user documentation
===============================

(needs revision)

Lino includes a set of tools for writing comprehensive 
multi-lingual user documentation for your Lino application.
It is a combination of `Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com>`_'s 
and `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_'s strength's.

When developing and maintaining a Lino application we suggest to
use two distinct Sphinx document trees:

- `/docs` for technical documentation (only English) 
- `/docs_xx` for user documentation (translated)
