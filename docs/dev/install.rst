This document describes how to install Lino.  It is written for
Debian_ and derivated distributions, other Linuxes should be pretty
similar.

It assumes you are familiar with the Linux shell at least for basic
file operations like :cmd:`ls`, :cmd:`cp`, :cmd:`mkdir`, :cmd:`rmdir`,
file permissions, environment variables, bash scripts etc.  Otherwise
we suggest to learn about :ref:`Working in a UNIX shell
<learning.unix>`.

System requirements
===================

#.  Lino theoretically works under **Python 3**, but we currently
    still recommend **Python 2**.  If you just want it to work, then
    choose Python 2. Otherwise consider giving it a try under Python 3
    and report your experiences.

#.  You need at least 500MB of RAM.  How to see how much memory you
    have::

        $ free -h

#.  We assume you have virtualenv_ and pip_ installed. See the next
    section.

#.  You will need to install git_ on your computer to get the source
    files::
      
      $ sudo apt-get install git

#.  Many Lino applications require lxml_, which has some extra
    requirements::

      $ sudo apt-get build-dep lxml

    Note: if you get an error message :message:`You must put some
    'source' URIs in your sources.list`, then (in Ubuntu) open
    :menuselection:`System Settings --> Software & Updates` and make
    sure that :guilabel:`Source code` is checked. Or (on the command
    line) edit your :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list` file::

        $ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
        $ sudo apt-get update

#.  Similar requirement for applications which use
    :mod:`lino.modlib.weasyprint`::

      $ sudo apt-get build-dep cairocffi
      $ sudo apt-get install libffi-dev

#.  For applications which use :mod:`lino.utils.html2xhtml`::

      $ sudo apt-get install tidy


.. _lino.dev.env:

Set up a Python environment
===========================

Before you actually install Lino into your Python, we recommend to
create a new Python environment using virtualenv_.

If you have never used virtual environments before, then on a Debian
system you will do something like::

        $ sudo pip install virtualenv
        $ mkdir ~/virtualenvs

Here is how to create a new virgin environment::
        
        $ virtualenv ~/virtualenvs/a

To *activate* this environment, you will type::

    $ . ~/virtualenvs/a/bin/activate

In a normal situation, all your Python projects can use the same
virtual environment.  So you probably want to add above line to your
:xfile:`.bashrc` file::

    $ echo ". ~/virtualenvs/a/bin/activate" >> ~/.bashrc

         
.. rubric:: Notes

We chose ``a`` as name for this environment. You might prefer
``lino``, ``dev`` or ``my_first_environment``.

If virtualenvs are new to you, then read Dan Poirier's post
`Managing multiple Python projects: Virtual environments
<https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2016/11/03/managing-multiple-python-projects-virtual-environments/>`__
where he explains what they are and why you want them.

The dot (``.``) is a synonym for the :cmd:`source` command. If you
didn't know it, read the `manpage
<http://ss64.com/bash/source.html>`__ and `What does 'source' do?
<http://superuser.com/questions/46139/what-does-source-do>`__

You can **deactivate** a virtual environment with the command
:cmd:`deactivate`. This switches you back to your machine's
system-wide environment.

You can **switch to another** virtualenv simply by activating it, you
don't need to deactivate the current one first.

You should never **rename** a virtualenv (they are not designed for
that), but you can easily create a new one and remove the old one.


Get the sources
===============

You might theoretically install Lino using ``pip install lino``, but
this method isn't currently being tested very thoroughly. So in most
cases we currently recommend to use the development version because
you will probably want to use Lino's newest features before they get
released on PyPI.

Create a directory (e.g. :file:`~/repositories`) meant to hold your
working copies of version-controlled software projects, `cd` to that
directory and and do::

  $ mkdir ~/repositories
  $ cd ~/repositories
  $ git clone https://github.com/lino-framework/lino.git
  $ git clone https://github.com/lino-framework/xl.git
  $ git clone https://github.com/lino-framework/cosi.git
  $ git clone https://github.com/lino-framework/book.git

You should now have four directories called `~/repositories/lino`,
`~/repositories/xl` , `~/repositories/cosi` and `~/repositories/book`,
each of which contains a file :xfile:`setup.py` and a whole tree of
other files and directories.

One possible problem here is that some repositories might have a big
size.  If you just want to get the latest version and don't plan to
submit any pull requests, then you can reduce download size by adding
``--depth 1`` and ``-b master`` options::

  $ git clone --depth 1 -b master https://...

(as explained in `this question on stackoverflow
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1209999/using-git-to-get-just-the-latest-revision>`__
or Nicola Paolucci's blog entry `How to handle big repositories with
git
<http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/05/handle-big-repositories-git/>`_).


Installation
============

Now you are ready to "install" Lino, i.e. to tell your Python
interpreter where the source file are, so that you can import them
from within any Python program.

Commands::

  $ pip install -e lino
  $ pip install -e xl
  $ pip install -e cosi
  $ pip install -e book

These commands take some time because they will download and install
all Python packages needed by Lino.

Note that the `-e
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#cmdoption-e>`_
command-line switch for :command:`pip` causes it to use the
"development" mode.  Development mode means that these modules run
"directly from source".  `pip` does not *copy* the sources to your
Python `site_packages`, but instead adds a link to them.  The first
argument after ``-e`` is not a *project name* but a *directory*.



Telling your Lino version
=========================

A quick test when you want to see whether Lino is installed is to say
"hello" to Lino:

.. py2rst::

   self.shell_block(["python", "-m", "lino.hello"])

In case you didn't know: Python's `-m
<https://docs.python.org/2/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m>`_
command-line switch instructs it to just *import* the specified module
(here :mod:`lino.hello`) and then to return to the command line.


Upgrading the sources
=====================

Actually the Lino version number is not enough when using a developer
installation of Lino.  The Lino codebase repository changes almost
every day, while the version is incremented only when we do an
official release to PyPI.

So as a developer you will simply upgrade your copy of the code
repositories often.  Here is a quick series of commands for getting
the latest version::

  $ cd ~/repositories/lino ; git pull 
  $ cd ~/repositories/xl ; git pull 
  $ cd ~/repositories/cosi ; git pull 
  $ cd ~/repositories/book ; git pull 
  $ find ~/repositories -name '*.pyc' -delete

This process is fully described in :doc:`pull`.

Troubleshooting
===============

Using virtual environments seems to be one of the biggest challenges
for newbies. Here are some diagnostic tricks.

How to see which is your current virtualenv::

    $ echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
    /home/luc/virtualenvs/a

    $ which python
    /home/luc/virtualenvs/a/bin/python

How to see what's installed in your current virtualenv::

    $ pip freeze

The output will be about 60 lines of text, here is an excerpt::
  
    alabaster==0.7.9
    appy==0.9.4
    argh==0.26.2
    ...
    Django==1.9.10

Initialize the demo databases
=============================

The Lino Book contains a series of demo projects, each of which has
its own database. These databases need to be initialized before you
can use these projects.

The easiest way to do this is to run the :cmd:`inv prep` command
from within your copy of the :ref:`book` repository::

    $ cd ~/repositories/book
    $ inv prep

The ``inv`` command has been installed on your system (more precisely:
into your Python environment) by the invoke_ package, which itself has
been required by atelier_, which is another Python package developed
by Luc.

The ``inv`` command is a kind of make tool which works by looking for
a file named :xfile:`tasks.py`. The Lino repository contains such a
file, and this file uses :mod:`lino.invlib`, which (together with
:mod:`atelier.invlib` from which it inherits) defines a whole series
of commands like :cmd:`inv prep` or :cmd:`inv test`.



Running your first Lino site
============================

You can now ``cd`` to any subdir of :mod:`lino_book.projects` and run
a development server::

  
    $ cd lino_book/projects/min1
    $ python manage.py runserver

Now start your browser, point it to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and play
around.

Don't stay in :mod:`min1 <lino_book.projects.min1>`, also try the
other projects below :mod:`lino_book.projects`. None of them is a
"killer app", they are just little projects used for testing and
playing.



Where to go from here
=====================

If you are reading the **Developer's Guide**, we now suggest to
:doc:`/tutorials/hello/index`.

If you are reading the **Administrator's Guide**, then continue where
you left in :doc:`/admin/install`.
