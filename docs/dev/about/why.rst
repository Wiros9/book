====================================
Why should a developer choose Lino?
====================================

As a professional Python developer you may ask why it would be worth to use Lino
as your framework for writing applications for your customers.

As an **independent developer** you can use the Lino framework for making
money. You write and maintain a Lino application for your customers, and they
pay you for your service. Lino is free software, but most people nowadays
understand the difference between free beer and free speech.

As an **inhouse developer** (i.e. you write a Lino application for your
employer) you simply replace "customer" by "employer".

As a **volunteer contributor** you will learn how to write business applications
without paying for your teachers.  You get full support by the core developers
for free.  We have a fundamental motivation for helping you with getting started
your business because building a sustainable open community is an important part
of our mission. Volunteer contributors contact us because they want to

- gain experience with working in an open-source software project
- increase their chances on the job market
- find a job at a :term:`Lino service provider <service provider>`
- start their own company as a :term:`Lino service provider <service provider>`


Lino is not a solution for everything. But for the kind of projects it is
designed for we believe that you and your customers will be more satisfied with
Lino...

- ... than with plain Django. See :doc:`lino_and_django`.

- ... than with a :term:`proprietary framework <proprietary software>`.

Note some limitations of Lino as a framework:

- Lino as a framework :ref:`does not try <not_easy>` to be easy to
  learn. This is a design choice, not a limitation.  You need an
  experienced Python developer for writing new Lino applications.
  Yes, such people tend to be expensive these days.
  But we believe that "frameworks for dummies" save money at the wrong
  end.  See also :ref:`lino.think_python`.

- Lino is not yet very well documented. This is the price of having a small
  community.
  But our community is growing and we are working on it.
  Our goal is that every interested reader finds answers to their
  questions about Lino.  You can help us by sending your feedback,
  tell us where you got stuck, help us to make it easier for others to
  get started with Lino.
