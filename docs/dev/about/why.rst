====================================
Why should a developer choose Lino?
====================================

As an **independent developer** you can use the Lino framework for making
money. You write and maintain a Lino application for your customers, and they
pay you for your service. Lino is free software, but most people nowadays
understand the difference between free beer and free speech.

As an **inhouse developer** (i.e. you write a Lino application for your
employer) you simply replace "customer" by "employer".

By contributing as a volunteer you will learn how to use Lino without paying
for your teachers.  You get full support by the core developers for free.  We
have a fundamental motivation for helping you with getting started your
business because building a sustainable open community is an important part of
our mission.

Lino is not a solution for everything. But for the kind of projects it is
designed for we believe that you and your customers will be more satisfied with
Lino...
