About functional specifications
===============================

The :doc:`/specs/index` section is an online document tree that
describes in detail what users can do with their Lino application.

It has individual subsections for every Lino application maintained by
the Lino team.  It also has general topic guides and plugin
descriptions for functionalities that are shared among several
applications.

Its primary audience are consultants, trainers and application
developers.

For application developers it provides an important introduction into
what a given plugin does or is expected to do.  It is also an integral
part of our test suite since all code examples are automatically being
verified before each release.

It contains at least one page for every plugin.  Every page ideally
explains all technical and functional aspects about a given plugin or
topic.  If some functionality is covered by another specs page, it
refers to these.
