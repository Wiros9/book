Technical specifications
========================

A **technical specification** page ("specs") is a page that contains prosa
documentation about a plugin.

Specs are meant rather for :term:`application developers <application
developer>`, trainers and technical analysts than for :term:`end users <end
user>`. It should describe what that plugin is being used for, and serve as a
reference documentation.

It provides an important introduction to what a given plugin does or is expected
to do. It ideally explains all relevant technical and functional aspects about
its topic topic. If some functionality is covered by a separate page, it refers
to these.

Specs are also an integral part of the test suite since all code examples are
automatically being verified before each release. More about this in
:ref:`tested document <tested_docs>`.
