Writing documentation
=====================

Writing documentation about Lino is a complex topic.  Note that we do
*not* provide documentation for *end-users* (which must be written per
application by the product owner).  The audience of Lino documentation
are trainers, consultants, application developers and core developers.
They need *topic overviews* as well as *reference documentation* about
every plugin.  Core developers additionally need documentation about
the Lino internals.
