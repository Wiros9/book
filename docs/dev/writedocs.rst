Writing documentation
=====================

Writing documentation about Lino is a complex topic. Some
considerations:

The audience of Lino documentation are trainers, consultants and
application developers who need topic overviews as well as reference
documentation about every plugin.  Core developers additionally need
documentation about the Lino internals.

We do our best to provide useful documentation for these users, but
*not* for end users.  End user documentation must be written per
application by the customer or the product owner.  We generally
recommend a LibreOffice document in order to avoid vendor lock-in.
