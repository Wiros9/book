============
Welcome
============

The Lino team welcomes both experienced Python developers and beginners.

A **Lino developer** is a person who knows what is documented in  the
:doc:`Developer Guide </dev/index>` so that they can write an application. As a
developer you use Lino to write your own Lino application and publish it using
your preferred license.   We are perfectly okay with this usage model.

A **Lino contributor** is a Lino developer who helps us to make Lino better. As
a contributor you contribute to the Lino community by  reporting about your
successes and failures,  testing general framework features, suggesting changes,
submitting pull requests, ... You will learn more than a simple developer. This
is documented in the :doc:`Contributor Guide </team/index>`.

Volunteer contributors contact us because they want to

- gain experience with working in an open-source software project
- increase their chances on the job market.
- find a job at a Lino service provider.
- start their own company as a Lino service provider.
