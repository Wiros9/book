=================================
Writing your own Lino application
=================================

Quick summary:

- Find a name for the Python package that will hold your application  (something
  like "Cos√¨", "Avanti", "Tera", "Voga", ...). Consult `PyPI
  <https://pypi.org/search/?q=lino_&o=>`__ for a list of names that are already
  taken.

  A good application name should identify your application so that its users can
  talk about it.

- Follow the instructions at https://algus.lino-framework.org/
