=============
The menu tree
=============

As we have seen, a description of a database application contains
models, tables, layouts and :doc:`actions <actions>`.  But one
important piece is missing: the **main menu**.

The main menu defines how the different functionalities of an
application should be presented to the user.

The application developer must decide how to organize the different
actors and actions of her application into a "menu structure".

This menu structure defines another level of grouping (into menu
groups).

Standard items of a main menu
=============================

:meth:`lino.core.site.Site.setup_menu`
:attr:`lino.core.site.Site.top_level_menus`


The Main menu

The Explorer menu

Introduction to menu groups
===========================

The different installed apps (identified by their `app_label`) are one
way to group your database models into different "modules".  But this
grouping almost never exactly matches how the users would modularize
their application.


TODO: write more about it.
