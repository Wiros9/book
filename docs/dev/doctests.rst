Tested documents
================

**Tested documents** are a way of writing test cases. They are pages
of a document tree which are being tested using Python's standard
doctest command.

The doctest command extracts code snippets from any text file, runs
them in a subprocess and then checks whether their output is the same
as the one displayed in the document.

Lino comes with some tools and shortcuts to make it easier to write
such documents.

Examples of such documents are all pages below :doc:`/specs/index`.
