Demo fixtures
=============

A **fixture**, in Django, is a portion of data (a collection of data
records in one or several tables) which can be loaded into a database.

.. xfile:: fixtures

Fixtures are defined by the files in so-called :xfile:`fixtures` directories.
When a plugin has a subpackage named :xfile:`fixtures`, Django will discover
this package when you run the :manage:`loaddata` command. This is standard
Django knowledge. Read more about it in the `Django documentation
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/initial-data/>`_.

Lino uses this to define the concept of **demo fixtures**. These are a
predefined set of fixture names to be specified by the application developer in
the :attr:`demo_fixtures <lino.core.site.Site.demo_fixtures>` attribute. The
`min1` application has the following value for this attribute:

>>> from lino import startup
>>> startup('lino_book.projects.min1.settings.demo')
>>> from django.conf import settings
>>> settings.SITE.demo_fixtures
'std demo demo2'

This means that the :manage:`prep` command (in a
:mod:`lino_book.projects.min1` application) is equivalent to::

  $ python manage.py initdb std demo demo2

The difference between :manage:`initdb` and :manage:`prep` is that with
:manage:`prep`, you don't need to know the list of demo fixtures when invoking
the command. The default list of demo fixtures to load for initializing a
"clean" standard demo database can be long and difficult to remember, and (more
importantly) which can change when an application evolves.  System
administrators usually don't *want* to know such details. As a future
application developer you can learn more about them in
:ref:`lino.tutorial.writing_fixtures`.

Note that in Lino we usually don't write fixtures in XML or JSON but
:doc:`write them in Python </dev/pyfixtures/index>`.

The loading phases of demo fixtures
===================================

We suggest to see each fixture name as a **loading phase**. It is up to the
application developer to specify a meaningful set of loading phases in the
:attr:`demo_fixtures <lino.core.site.Site.demo_fixtures>` setting.

Our convention is to define the following loading phases::

    std minimal_ledger demo demo_bookings payments demo2 checkdata

:fixture:`std`
:fixture:`minimal_ledger`
:fixture:`demo`
:fixture:`demo_bookings`
:fixture:`payments`
:fixture:`demo2`
:fixture:`checkdata`


The loading order of demo data is important because the fixtures of the
:ref:`xl` are inter-dependent.  They create users, cities, journals, contacts,
invoices, payments, reports, notifications, ...  you cannot write invoices if
you have no customers, and an accounting report makes no sense if bank
statements haven't been entered.

Lino basically uses Django's approach of finding demo fixtures: When Django
gets a series of fixture names to load, it will load them in the specified
order, and for each fixture will ask each plugin to load that fixture.  If a
plugin doesn't define a fixture of that name, it simply does nothing.

The :attr:`demo_fixtures <lino.core.site.Site.demo_fixtures>` setting is a
string with a space-separated list of fixture names to be loaded by
:manage:`prep`.

.. fixture:: std

The :fixture:`std` fixtures should add default database content expected to be
in a virgin database even when no "demo data" is requested. This should always
be the first fixture of your :attr:`demo_fixtures
<lino.core.site.Site.demo_fixtures>` setting.  It is provided by the following
plugins:

- :mod:`lino.modlib.users`
  Create an excerpt type "Welcome letter" (when appypod and excerpts are installed)

- :mod:`lino.modlib.tinymce`
- :mod:`lino.modlib.gfks`
- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cv`
- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.coachings`
- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.bevat` creates an excerpt type for the VAT declaration.
- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.bevats` does nothing
- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.eevat` does nothing
- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.contacts` adds a series of default company types.

- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.deploy`
- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.pages`

- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.ledger` creates some *payment terms*.
  Creates an *account* for every item of
  :class:`CommonAccounts <lino_xl.lib.ledger.CommonAccounts>`, which results in a minimal
  accounts chart.

- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.sheets`
  creates common sheet items and assigns them to their accounts.

- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.households` adds some household member roles.

- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.cal` installs standard calendar entry types, including a
  set of holidays.  (TODO: make them more configurable.)
  The default value of
  :attr:`lino.modlib.system.SiteConfig.hide_events_before` is set to
  January 1st (of the current year when demo_date is after April and of
  the previous year when demo_date is before April).
  See also :ref:`xl.specs.holidays`.

- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.sales` creates some common paper types.

- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.working`
- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.polls`
- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.notes`
- :mod:`lino_xl.lib.excerpts`
