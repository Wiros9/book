Send a patch
============

The most basic way of contributing a code change is to send a patch. Here is how
to do that.

Go to the project root directory and type::

    $ git diff > mypatch.txt

Send the file :file:`mypatch.txt` via e-mail to a committer (somebody who has
write permission to the public code repositories).
