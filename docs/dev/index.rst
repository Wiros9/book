A **Lino developer** is a guy who knows the Python programming
language and the Lino concepts so that they can use it to write an
application.  Developers can be **volunteer** contributors,
independant **freelancers** or **employed** by some company.

Individual contributors
=======================

The Lino team welcomes both experienced developers and beginners.

- We need **experienced** Python developers who dare to discuss with
  Luc about project management and development workflow. Lino is
  constantly growing from a beast developed by a single developer into
  a community project.

- We help **beginners** to learn how to write your own Lino application.  You
  get a free mentorship and increase your chances on the job market.

**Volunteer contributors** contact us because they want to

- gain experience with working in an open-source software project

- find a job at one of the recommended companies offering Lino
  development.

- start their own company which offers Lino development

We can differentiate developers by their *primary interest*:

- **Core developers** help us to make Lino better.  This includes the
  core of the framework itself, the :ref:`xl` and the
  :ref:`lino.apps`.

- **Application developers** write their own independent Lino
  applications and publish them using their preferred license.
