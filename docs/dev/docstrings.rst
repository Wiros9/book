.. _dev.docstrings::

============================
Where to put your docstrings
============================

Usage example is :mod:`lino.modlib.users` where all the docstrings
have been moved to the :ref:`specs`. I believe that this is now
finally our prefererred way for structuring the documentation of a
plugin. I created :ticket:`1708` for this and started this document.
