Introduction to plugins
=======================

A **plugin** is a Python package that can be "installed" by a :term:`Lino
application`. It encapsulates a set of *functionality* designed to be
potentially used in more than on application.

A Lino plugin corresponds to what *Django* calls an "application". Lino's
:class:`Plugin <lino.core.plugin.Plugin>` class is comparable to Django's
`AppConfig <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/applications/>`_ class,
but has some additional features, which makes them the preferred way.

Usage overview
==============

A plugin can define database models, actors, actions, fixtures, template files,
javascript snippets, dependencies,  and :term:`configuration settings <plugin
configuration setting>`.  None of these are mandatory.

The :term:`application developer` defines which plugins to install in the
application's :meth:`get_installed_apps
<lino.core.site.Site.get_installed_apps>` method.

The plugin developer defines a plugin in the :xfile:`__init__.py` file of the
package.  Lino expects this file to define a class named ``Plugin``, which
inherits from the abstract base :class:`Plugin <lino.core.plugin.Plugin>` class.
Your :class:`Plugin <lino.core.plugin.Plugin>` class is the central description
of your plugin.

Here is a fictive example::

    from lino.api import ad, _

    class Plugin(ad.Plugin):
        verbose_name = _("Better calendar")
        extends = 'mylib.cal'
        needs_plugins  = ['lino_xl.lib.contacts']

        def setup_main_menu(self, site, user_type, m):
            m = m.add_menu(self.app_label, self.verbose_name)
            m.add_action('cal.Teams')
            m.add_action('cal.Agendas')


A plugin can **depend on other plugins** by specifying them in the
:attr:`needs_plugins <lino.core.plugin.Plugin.needs_plugins>`
attribute. This means that when you install this plugin, Lino will
automatically install these other plugins as well

A plugin can define a set of **menu commands** using methods like
:meth:`setup_main_menu
<lino.core.plugin.Plugin.setup_main_menu>`. This is explained in
:doc:`menu`.

And last but not least, a plugin can **extend** another plugin by
specifying its name in :attr:`extends_models
<lino.core.plugin.Plugin.extends_models>`.  This is explained in
:doc:`plugin_inheritance`.

.. _dev.accessing.plugins:


Accessing plugins
=================

Django developers are used to code like this::

    from myapp.models import Foo

    def print_foo(pk=1):
        print(Foo.objects.get(pk=pk))

In Lino we prefer to use the :attr:`rt.models <lino.api.rt.models>` dict as
follows::

    from lino.api import rt

    def print_foo(pk=1):
        Foo = rt.models.myapp.Foo
        print(Foo.objects.get(pk=pk))

This approach has the advantage of providing :doc:`plugin_inheritance`. One of
the basic reasons for using plugins is that another developer can extend it and
use their extension instead of the original plugin. Which means that the plugin
developer does not know (and does not *want* to know) where the model classes
are actually defined.

Note that :attr:`rt.models <lino.api.rt.models>` is populated only
*after* having imported the models. So you cannot use it at the
module-level namespace of a :xfile:`models.py` module.  For example
the following variant of above code **would not work**::

    from lino.api import rt
    Foo = rt.models.foos.Foo  # error `AttrDict has no item "foos"`
    def print_foo(pk=1):
        print(Foo.objects.get(pk=pk))


Configuring plugins
===================

.. currentmodule:: lino.core.site

Plugins can have **attributes** for holding configurable options.

Examples of configurable plugin attributes:

- :attr:`lino_xl.lib.countries.Plugin.country_code`
- :attr:`lino_xl.lib.contacts.Plugin.hide_region`

The values of plugin attributes can be configured at three levels.

As a **plugin developer** you specify a hard-coded default value.

As an :term:`application developer` you can specify default values in your
application by overriding the :meth:`Site.get_plugin_configs` of your Site
class.  For example::

    class Site(Site):

        def get_plugin_configs(self):
            yield super(Site, self).get_plugin_configs()
            yield ('countries', 'country_code', 'BE')
            yield ('contacts', 'hide_region', True)

The old style using :meth:`Site.setup_plugins` still works but is deprecated::

    class Site(Site):

        def setup_plugins(self):
            super(Site, self).setup_plugins()
            self.plugins.countries.configure(country_code='BE')
            self.plugins.contacts.configure(hide_region=True)

Note that :meth:`Site.setup_plugins` is called *after*
:meth:`Site.get_plugin_configs`. This can cause unexpected behaviour when you
mix both methods.

As a **system administrator** you can override these configuration
defaults in your project's :xfile:`settings.py` using one of the
following methods:

- by overriding the Site class as described above for application
  developers

- by setting the value directly after instantiation of your
  :setting:`SITE` object.

Another (deprecated) method is by using the :func:`configure_plugin` function.
For example::

    from lino_cosi.lib.cosi.settings import *
    configure_plugin('countries', country_code='BE')
    SITE = Site(globals())

Beware the pitfall: :func:`configure_plugin` must be called *before* the
:setting:`SITE` has been instantiated, otherwise *they will be ignored
silently*.  (It is not easy to prevent accidental calls to it *after*
Site initialization because there are scenarios where you want to
instantiate several `Site` objects.)

Keep in mind that you can indeed never be sure that your :setting:`SITE`
instance is actually being used. A local system admin can always decide to
import your :xfile:`settings.py` module and to re-instantiate your `Site` class
another time. That's part of our game and we don't want it to be forbidden.
