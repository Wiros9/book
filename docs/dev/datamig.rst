Data migrations Ã  la Lino
=========================

Overview
========

Data migration is a complex topic. Django needed until version 1.7
before they dared to suggest a default method to automating these
tasks (see `Migrations
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/>`_).

Lino includes a system for managing database migrations which takes a
rather different approach than what Django does.

Advantages of Lino migrations:

- They help making the whole process of developing applications (which
  includes testing, maintaining and documenting) more natural and
  easier to manage.

- They work also when you use the :doc:`inject_field` and :ref:`mldbc`
  features.

Lino suggests to *not use* Django migrations. At least if you want to
use either the :doc:`inject_field <inject_field>` or :ref:`BabelField
<mldbc>` features. If your application uses them (or if it uses a
plugin which uses them), then Django migrations won't work.

You might still want to use the Django approach because Lino
migrations have one inevitable **disadvantage**: they can take half an
hour to run. Users must stop working in your application during that
time.  There are systems where half an hour downtime for an upgrade is
not acceptable.

If you *do* need to use Django migrations in your Lino application,
then you may not use :doc:`inject_field <inject_field>` and
:ref:`BabelField <mldbc>`.


General strategy for handling data migrations
=============================================

The basic idea is that you :doc:`write a Python dump </dev/dump2py>`
with the old version (*before* upgrading), and that you load that dump
with the new version (*after* upgrading).

- When you upgrade on a production site, always make a Python dump
  (using :manage:`dump2py`) of your database **before** the upgrade.

- **After** the upgrade, reinitialize your database from that dump by
  running the :xfile:`restore.py` script.

Certain schema changes will migrate automatically: new models, new
fields (when they have a default value), `unique` constraints, ...

If there were unhandled schema changes, you will get error messages.
This is no reason to panic. Just change your code and try again.  You
can run the :xfile:`restore.py` script as often as needed until there
are no more errors.

There are two ways for correcting your code: either by locally
modifying your :xfile:`restore.py` script or by writing a migrator.


Modifying :xfile:`restore.py` script
====================================

Locally modifying a :xfile:`restore.py` script is the natural way when
there is only one production site who needs to be migrated. It is a
common situation when a new customer project has gone into production
but is being used only on that customer's site.

Look at the code of your :xfile:`restore.py` script.

For example if a model or field has been removed, you can just comment
out one line in that script.

See also :doc:`dump2py`.
