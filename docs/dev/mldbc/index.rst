=============================
Multilingual database content
=============================

.. how to test:
    $ python setup.py test -s tests.DocsTests.test_mldbc

    >>> from lino import startup
    >>> startup('lino_book.projects.mldbc.settings')
    >>> from lino.api.shell import *
    >>> Product = rt.models.mldbc.Product


One feature of Lino is its built-in support for :ref:`single-table
multilingual database content <mldbc>`.  This tutorial explains what
it is.

Note that we are **not** talking about Internationalization (i18n)
here.  *Internationalization* is when the *user interface* is in
different languages.  Lino has nothing to add to the existing Django
techniques about `Internationalization
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/>`__, that's why we
deliberately didn't translate the user interface in this tutorial.



When to use BabelFields
-----------------------

Imagine a Canadian company which wants to print catalogs and price
offers in an English and a French version, depending on the customer's
preferred language.  They don't want to maintain different product
tables because it is one company, one accounting, and prices are the
same in French and in English.  They need a Products table like this:

  +------------------+------------------+-------------+-------+----+
  | Designation (en) | Designation (fr) | Category    | Price | ID |
  +==================+==================+=============+=======+====+
  | Chair            | Chaise           | Accessories | 29.95 | 1  |
  +------------------+------------------+-------------+-------+----+
  | Table            | Table            | Accessories | 89.95 | 2  |
  +------------------+------------------+-------------+-------+----+
  | Monitor          | Ã‰cran            | Hardware    | 19.95 | 3  |
  +------------------+------------------+-------------+-------+----+
  | Mouse            | Souris           | Accessories |  2.95 | 4  |
  +------------------+------------------+-------------+-------+----+
  | Keyboard         | Clavier          | Accessories |  4.95 | 5  |
  +------------------+------------------+-------------+-------+----+

Now imagine that your application is being used not only in Canada but
also in the United States.  Of course, your US customers don't want to
have a "useless" column for the French designation of their products.

This is where you want multi-lingual database content.

In that case you would simply

- use :class:`BabelCharField <lino.utils.mldbc.fields.BabelCharField>`
  instead of Django's `CharField` for every translatable field and

- set the :attr:`languages <lino.core.site.Site.languages>` attribute
  to ``"en"`` for US customers and to ``"en fr"`` for Canadian
  customers.

An example
==========

Go to :mod:`lino_book.projects.mldbc`::

   $ go mldbc

Make sure that the demo database is initialized::
   
   $ python manage.py prep
   

Using the shell
---------------

Now open the interactive Django shell::

  $ python manage.py shell

You can print a catalog in different languages:

>>> print(', '.join([unicode(p) for p in Product.objects.all()]))
Chair, Table, Monitor, Mouse, Keyboard, Consultation

>>> from django.utils import translation
>>> with translation.override('fr'):
...     print(', '.join([unicode(p) for p in Product.objects.all()]))
Chaise, Table, Ecran, Souris, Clavier, Consultation

Here is how we got the above table:

>>> from lino.api import rt
>>> rt.show(mldbc.Products)
==================== ================== ============= ============
 Designation          Designation (fr)   Category      Price
-------------------- ------------------ ------------- ------------
 Chair                Chaise             Accessories   29,95
 Table                Table              Accessories   89,95
 Monitor              Ecran              Hardware      19,95
 Mouse                Souris             Accessories   2,95
 Keyboard             Clavier            Accessories   4,95
 Consultation         Consultation       Service       59,95
 **Total (6 rows)**                                    **207,70**

Using the web interface
-----------------------

Note: If you have a development version of Lino, then you can run
directly from the Lino source repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ go mldbc
  $ python manage.py prep
  $ python manage.py runserver
  Creating test database for alias 'default'...
  INFO Analyzing models...
  INFO Loading ~/snapshots/lino/lino/docs/tutorials/mldbc/fixtures/demo.py...
  Installed 6 object(s) from 1 fixture(s)
  Validating models...

  0 errors found
  Django version 1.6.8, using settings 'mldbc.settings'
  Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
  Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.

The screenshots on the left have been taken on a server with 
``languages = ['en']``,
those on the right on a server with 
``languages = ['de','fr']``.

The :xfile:`settings.py` file
-----------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../lino_book/projects/mldbc/settings.py

This is where you specify the :setting:`languages` setting.


The :xfile:`models.py` file
---------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../lino_book/projects/mldbc/models.py

Note that this is the first time we use a 
:class:`dd.ChoiceList <lino.core.choicelists.ChoiceList>`
they deserve another tutorial on their own.


The `demo` fixture
------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../lino_book/projects/mldbc/fixtures/demo.py

Note how the application developer doesn't know which :attr:`languages
<lino.core.site.Site.languages>` will be set at runtime.

Of course the fixture above supposes a single person who knows 
all the languages, but that's just because we are simplifying. 
In reality you can do it as sophisticated as you want, 
reading the content from different sources.
