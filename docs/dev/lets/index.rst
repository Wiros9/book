=============================
A Local Exchange Trade System
=============================

In this tutorial we imagine a whole Lino project, from analysis to deployment,
testing and documentation.  The fictive application described here is probably a
bit too simple for a real-life website.  But we *imagine* that this is what our
customer *asked* us to do.  More about the Lino application development process
in :doc:`/dev/analysis`.
