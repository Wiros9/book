We have a separate repository `manuals
<https://github.com/lino-framework/manuals/>`__ with the source code
of user manuals maintained by the Lino team.  Every pilot customer
with a customized Lino application get their user manual in the
language agreed with the customer.  We currently offer English, German
and French.  The quality and coverage of user manuals is as good as
the customer demands and agrees to pay for.
