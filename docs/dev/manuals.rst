Manuals for end-users
=====================

The Lino team maintains a series of user manuals targeted at
non-programmers:

- `Lino Noi (en) <http://noi.lino-framework.org>`__
- `Lino Tera (de) <http://de.tera.lino-framework.org>`__
- `Lino Welfare var. Eupen (de) <http://de.welfare.lino-framework.org>`__
- `Lino Welfare var. Ch√¢telet (fr) <http://fr.welfare.lino-framework.org>`__

Every pilot customer with a customized Lino application get their user
manual in the language agreed with the customer.  The quality and
coverage of user manuals is as good as the customer demands and agrees
to pay for.

The source code for these manuals is in a separate repository `manuals
<https://github.com/lino-framework/manuals/>`__.  Each user manual is
a doctree on its own in this repository.
