Creating a root user
====================

The most Linoish way to create a root user (or a set of demo users) is
to run :manage:`prep`.  This will reset the database to a
virgin state and then load all your demo data, which includes
:mod:`lino.modlib.users.fixtures.demo_users` (except if you changed
your :attr:`lino.core.site.Site.demo_fixtures`).

If you don't want to reset your database, then you can write a script
and run it with :manage:`run`. For example::

    from lino.api.shell import users
    obj = users.User(username="root")
    obj.set_password("1234!")
    obj.full_clean()
    obj.save()



Passwords
=========

Note that the `password` field of a newly created user is empty,
and the account therefore cannot be used to log in.  If you create
a new user manually using the web interface, you must click their
:class:`ChangePassword` action and set their password.

>>> try:
...     users.User.objects.get(username="test").delete()
... except users.User.DoesNotExist:
...    pass
>>> u = users.User(username="test")
>>> u.save()
>>> print(u.has_usable_password())
False


The `password` field is empty, and the :meth:`User.check_password`
method returns `False`:

>>> rmu(u.password)
''
>>> print(u.check_password(''))
False

When setting the password for a newly created user, leave the
field :guilabel:`Current password` empty.

>>> ses = rt.login('robin')
>>> values = dict(current="", new1="1234", new2="1234")
>>> rv = ses.run(u.change_password, action_param_values=values)
>>> print(rv['message'])
New password has been set for test.
