From this point on, the Developer's Guide is far from being complete.
You must now learn how to explore a Python project on your own.

Lino is a big project and nobody pays me for writing this
documentation.  But keep in mind that Lino belongs to us all because
it is free software.  Ask questions when you get stuck.  Your
questions are important feedback, and your work of formulating them is
already a contribution for making Lino better.

A few guidelines for under your pillow:

- Inspect the examples and read the code.
- Don't hesitate changing the source code and see what it does.
- When you get error messages, don't try to "just get rid of them",
  rather understand what they mean and learn from them.
- Read Hamza's tutorial `Discovering Lino using your debugger
  <https://github.com/lino-framework/book/raw/master/docs/dev/discovering_lino_using_your_debugger.pdf>`__.
