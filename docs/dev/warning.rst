The Developer's Guide is far from being complete.  Lino is a big
project, but we are a small community and have limited resources for
writing documentation.  But keep in mind that Lino belongs to us all
because it is free software.  You can help us by asking questions when
you get stuck.  Your questions are important feedback, and your work
of formulating them is already a contribution for making Lino better.

Working on Free software implies that you learn how to explore a
Python project on your own.

A few guidelines for under your pillow:

- Inspect the examples and read the code.
- Don't hesitate changing the source code and see what it does.
- When you get error messages, don't try to "just get rid of them",
  rather understand what they mean and learn from them.
  
- Read Hamza's tutorial `Discovering Lino using your debugger
  <https://github.com/lino-framework/book/raw/master/docs/dev/discovering_lino_using_your_debugger.pdf>`__.
- Read Steven Kryskalla's `Advanced Python Debugging with pdb
  <https://www.codementor.io/stevek/advanced-python-debugging-with-pdb-g56gvmpfa>`.
