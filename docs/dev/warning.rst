From this point on, the Developer's Guide is far from being complete.
You must now learn how to explore a Python project on your own.

Lino is a big project, but we are a small community and have limited
resources for writing documentation.  But keep in mind that Lino
belongs to us all because it is free software.  You must help us.  Ask
questions when you get stuck.  Your questions are important feedback,
and your work of formulating them is already a contribution for making
Lino better.

A few guidelines for under your pillow:

- Inspect the examples and read the code.
- Don't hesitate changing the source code and see what it does.
- When you get error messages, don't try to "just get rid of them",
  rather understand what they mean and learn from them.
  
- Read Hamza's tutorial `Discovering Lino using your debugger
  <https://github.com/lino-framework/book/raw/master/docs/dev/discovering_lino_using_your_debugger.pdf>`__.
- Read Steven Kryskalla's `Advanced Python Debugging with pdb
  <https://www.codementor.io/stevek/advanced-python-debugging-with-pdb-g56gvmpfa>`.
