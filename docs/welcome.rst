Welcome

The Lino community welcomes both experienced and newbie Python developers.

Give us your feedback or to ask for help. Ways to contact us:

- Submit an issue on our `GitHub page <https://github.com/lino-framework>`__
  (submit to the `book repository
  <https://github.com/lino-framework/book/issues>`_ if you can't
  decide which repository is the right one).

- Subscribe to the `developers@lino-framework.org mailing list
  <https://lino-framework.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/lino-developers>`__
  and send an email.

- Contact one of the team directly: https://saffre-rumma.net/team/

Volunteer contributors contact us because they want to

- gain experience with working in an open-source software project
- increase their chances on the job market
- find a job at a :term:`Lino service provider <service provider>`
- start their own company as a :term:`Lino service provider <service provider>`

We differentiate three profiles of readers.

- As a :term:`site administrator` you want to run some existing :term:`Lino
  application` in a reliable way on a :term:`production server`. This is
  documented in the :doc:`Administrator Guide </admin/index>`.

- As an :term:`application developer` you use Lino to write your own Lino
  application. You should read the :doc:`Developer Guide </dev/index>`.
  You are welcome to contribute to the :term:`Lino community` by reporting about
  your successes and failures, and suggesting changes and new features,
  regardless of whether you publish your own work as :term:`free <free
  software>` or :term:`proprietary <proprietary software>` software.

- As a :term:`contributing developer` you want to help us
  to make Lino better by submitting pull requests.
  You should also read the :doc:`Developer Guide </dev/index>`,
  but you need to know more than a simple developer:
  you must also read the :doc:`Contributor Guide </team/index>`.

If several profiles match your motivations, we recommend the above reading
order.
