This is the technical documentation about the :term:`Lino framework`.

The Lino community welcomes both experienced and newbie Python developers.

Volunteer contributors contact us because they want to

- gain experience with working in an open-source software project
- increase their chances on the job market
- find a job at a :term:`Lino service provider <service provider>`
- start their own company as a :term:`Lino service provider <service provider>`

We differentiate three profiles of readers.

.. glossary::

  Application developer

    As an **application developer** you use Lino to write your own Lino
    application. For yourself, for your customer or for your employer. You maybe
    do this as an independent professional and potentially publish your work
    using your preferred license as :term:`free <free software>` or
    :term:`proprietary <proprietary software>` software. You are welcome to
    contribute to the :term:`Lino community` by reporting about your successes
    and failures, and suggesting changes and new features. You should read the
    :doc:`Developer Guide </dev/index>`.

  Contributing developer

    As a **contributing developer** you know more than a simple developer.
    After having read the :doc:`Developer Guide </dev/index>`, you want to help us to make Lino better.
    You contribute to the project by testing general framework features,
    discussing changes and new features, submitting pull requests, ...
    This is documented in the :doc:`Contributor Guide </team/index>`.

  Site administrator

    As a **site administrator** you want to run some :term:`Lino application`
    in a reliable way on a :term:`production server`.
    This is documented in the :doc:`Administrator Guide </admin/index>`.

If several profiles match your motivations, we recommend the above reading
order.
