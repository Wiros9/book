We differentiate three profiles of readers.


.. glossary::

  Lino developer

    As a **Lino developer** you use Lino to write your own Lino application.
    Probably for your customer or your employer. You maybe want to do this as an
    independent professional and potentially publish your work using your
    preferred license as :term:`free <free software>` or :term:`proprietary
    <proprietary software>` software. You are welcome to contribute to the
    :term:`Lino community` by reporting about your successes and failures, and
    suggesting changes and new features. You should read the :doc:`Developer
    Guide </dev/index>`.

  Lino contributor

    As a **Lino contributor** you know more than a simple developer.
    After having read the :doc:`Developer Guide </dev/index>`, you want to help us to make Lino better.
    You contribute to the project by testing general framework features,
    discussing changes and new features, submitting pull requests, ...
    This is documented in the :doc:`Contributor Guide </team/index>`.

  Site administrator

    As a **site administrator** you want to run some :term:`Lino application`
    in a reliable way on a :term:`production server`.
    This is documented in the :doc:`Contributor Guide </team/index>`.

If several profiles match your motivations, we recommend the above reading
order.
