Welcome
=======

The Lino community welcomes both experienced and new Python developers. We
differentiate three profiles of readers.

- As an :term:`application developer` you want to use Lino for writing your own
  Lino application. You should read the :doc:`Developer Guide </dev/index>`.
  You write pure Python code, you don't hassle with Javascript or CSS.  Your
  main focus is the business logic of your customer.

  You are welcome to contribute to the :term:`Lino community` by reporting about
  your successes and failures, and suggesting changes and new features,
  regardless of whether you publish your own work as :term:`free <free
  software>` or :term:`proprietary <proprietary software>` software.

- As a :term:`contributing developer` you want to help us to make Lino better by
  submitting pull requests. You should also read the :doc:`Developer Guide
  </dev/index>` because these are your "customers", but you need to know more
  than this. You might find yourself writing the Python code that generates the
  React and Javascript code that makes up a Lino :term:`front end`.  This is
  covered by the :doc:`Contributor Guide </team/index>`.

- As a :term:`site administrator` you want to run some existing :term:`Lino
  application` in a reliable way on a :term:`production server`. This is
  documented in the :doc:`Hoster Guide </admin/index>`.

This guide should be interesting and understandable for any motivated Python
developer with at least basic knowledge. But please let us know whenever you
stumble over a section that does not satisfy this noble goal. We count on you as
a reader to help us. The mere fact of asking for help and giving feedback is
already a contribution to making this guide better.
