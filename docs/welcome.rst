Welcome

The Lino community welcomes both experienced and newbie Python developers.

This guide should be interesting and understandable for any motivated Python
developer with at least basic knowledge.
But please let us know whenever you
stumble over a section that does not satisfy this noble goal.
We count on you as a reader to help us.
The mere fact of asking for help and giving feedback is already a contribution
to making this guide better.

Ways to contact us:

- Submit an issue on our `GitHub page <https://github.com/lino-framework>`__
  (submit to the `book repository
  <https://github.com/lino-framework/book/issues>`_ if you can't
  decide which repository is the right one).

- Subscribe to the `developers@lino-framework.org mailing list
  <https://lino-framework.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/lino-developers>`__
  and send an email.

- Contact one of the team directly: https://saffre-rumma.net/team/

Volunteer contributors contact us because they want to

- gain experience with working in an open-source software project
- increase their chances on the job market
- find a job at a :term:`Lino service provider <service provider>`
- start their own company as a :term:`Lino service provider <service provider>`

We differentiate three profiles of readers.

- As an :term:`application developer` you want to use Lino for writing your own
  Lino application. You should read the :doc:`Developer Guide </dev/index>`. You
  are welcome to contribute to the :term:`Lino community` by reporting about
  your successes and failures, and suggesting changes and new features,
  regardless of whether you publish your own work as :term:`free <free
  software>` or :term:`proprietary <proprietary software>` software.

- As a :term:`contributing developer` you want to help us to make Lino better by
  submitting pull requests. You should also read the :doc:`Developer Guide
  </dev/index>`, but you need to know more than a simple developer: you must
  also read the :doc:`Contributor Guide </team/index>`.

- As a :term:`site administrator` you want to run some existing :term:`Lino
  application` in a reliable way on a :term:`production server`. This is
  documented in the :doc:`Hoster Guide </admin/index>`.
