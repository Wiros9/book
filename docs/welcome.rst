Welcome
=======

The technical documentation about Lino is targeted at three different types of
professional activity.

- As a :term:`site administrator` you want to run some existing :term:`Lino
  application` on a :term:`production server`. You don't need profound knowledge
  of the Python language itself, but you will deal with installing Python
  packages. This is documented in the :doc:`Hoster Guide </admin/index>`.

- As an :term:`application developer` you want write your own Lino application
  and focus on the business logic of your customer who wants a customized
  database application. You will write pure Python code and learn how to use
  Lino and its underlying framework, Django. This is documented in the
  :doc:`Developer Guide </dev/index>`.

- As a :term:`contributing developer` you want to help us to make Lino better.
  You must understand the two other activities because these are your
  "customers", but you need to know more than this. You might find yourself
  writing the Python code that generates the React and Javascript code that
  makes up a Lino :term:`front end`.  This is covered by the :doc:`Contributor
  Guide </team/index>`.


How to contact us
=================

The Lino book is very interesting and understandable for anybody who wants to
learn one of these activities. At least in theory.  Please let us know when you
stumble into a place where theory doesn't match reality. We count on you as a
reader to help us.

Lino is free software, it belongs to us all.  The mere fact of asking for help
and giving feedback is already a contribution to making this guide better. The
:term:`Lino community` thanks you in advance.
