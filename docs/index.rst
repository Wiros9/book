=============
The Lino Book
=============

Welcome to the Lino Book, the technical documentation about the :term:`Lino
framework`. For non-technical documentation about Lino see the :ref:`cg`.

This website is meant to be read like a book, in sequence. Use the "next" and
"previous" links for navigation.  Feel free to jump to linked pages, but don't
get lost into details.

The Lino Book should be interesting and understandable for any motivated Python
developer with at least basic knowledge.  But it is only **work in progress**
and we count on you as a reader to help us. Please let us know whenever you
stumble over a section that does not satisfy the goal of this book.
