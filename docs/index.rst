==================
The Lino framework
==================

Welcome to the online version of the Lino Book, the free documentation
repository about the Lino framework.

It contains everything one might want to know about Lino.  Of course
this goal is not fully reached and never will be.  But already now the
audience of this book ranges from deciders without technical knowledge
over Python developers and Linux system administrators to end-users.
Of course each of these groups has their own section since their
interests and languages tend to differ substantially.

.. Rumma & Ko is `hiring people <http://www.saffre-rumma.net/jobs>`_
   to help us with our work on Lino.
