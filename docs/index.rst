=============
The Lino Book
=============

Welcome to the Lino Book, the technical documentation about the :term:`Lino
framework`. For non-technical documentation about Lino see the :ref:`cg`.

This website is meant to be read like a book, in sequence. Use the "next" and
"previous" links for navigation.

This book should be interesting and understandable for any motivated developer
with at least basic knowledge.  But it is also *work in progress* and we count
on you as a reader to help us. Please let us know whenever you stumble over a
section that does not seem to satisfy the goal of this book.
