===============================
Diamond inheritance (continued)
===============================

Note: This test is skipped in Django 1.11+ where Django says::     

    SystemCheckError: System check identified some issues:
    ERRORS:
    main.PizzeriaBar: (models.E005) The field 'restaurant_ptr' from parent model 'main.bar' clashes with the field 'restaurant_ptr' from parent model 'main.pizzeria'.

    (TODO: verify whether this is a problem)

This document shows a case of multi-table diamond inheritance which
was caused problems in Django 1.7.  The difference with
:doc:`../diamond/index` is that now we have two abstract parents.

This document also shows that Lino has a work-around for both
problems. Unfortunately that workaround works only until Django
1.6. We had some fun to adapt it to newer Django versions.

The source code used to generate and test this document is at
:srcref:`docs/tested/diamond2/`.

Our database structure is defined in :file:`main/models.py` as
follows:

.. literalinclude:: main/models.py


The problem
===========


>>> from main.models import PizzeriaBar
>>> p = PizzeriaBar(name="A", min_age="B", specialty="C",
...     pizza_bar_specific_field="Doodle")

Despite the fact that we specify a non-blank value for `name`, we get
a database object whose `name` is blank, while the
`pizza_bar_specific_field` field is not:

>>> print(p.name)
<BLANKLINE>
>>> print(p.pizza_bar_specific_field)
Doodle
