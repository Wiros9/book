Setting up a Lino production server
===================================

.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/
.. _virtualenv: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

Here is a set of conventions we suggest to use as a :term:`site maintainer` when
setting up a Lino :term:`production server`.


Activate the master environment
===============================

For every new maintainer of a production site, add the following line to your
:xfile:`.bashrc` in order to have the :term:`master environment` activated each
time you connect to the server::

    . /usr/local/lino/shared/env/master/bin/activate

.. glossary::

  master environment

    A virtualenv to be used as default virtualenv for all :term:`site
    maintainers <site maintainer>` on this :term:`production server`.  It mainly
    contains :ref:`getlino`.

The :term:`master environment` of a :term:`production server` is by convention
in :file:`/usr/local/lino/shared/env`.

Configure the domain name of your server
========================================

If your customers want to access their Lino from outside of their intranet, then
you need to setup a domain name.



Set up a master environment
===========================

If you are the first :term:`site maintainer` on this :term:`server <production
server>`, you must set up the :term:`master environment`::

    $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lino/shared/env
    $ cd /usr/local/lino/shared/env
    $ sudo chown root:www-data .
    $ sudo chmod g+ws .
    $ virtualenv -p python3 master
    $ . /usr/local/lino/shared/env/master/bin/activate


Install :mod:`getlino` into the :term:`master environment`::

    $ pip install getlino

Run :cmd:`getlino configure` as root::

   $ sudo env PATH=$PATH getlino configure --no-clone --appy --web-server nginx --https

Note: The ``env PATH=$PATH`` is needed to work around the controversial Debian
feature of overriding the :envvar:`PATH` for security reasons (`source
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/257616/why-does-sudo-change-the-path>`__).

The ``--web-server`` option can be either ``nginx`` or ``apache``. Your choice.

The ``--https`` option causes :cmd:`getlino configure` to (1) install certbot
and (2) have it request a new certificate for every :cmd:`getlino startsite`.

When at least one :term:`Lino site` of a server uses :mod:`lino_xl.lib.appypod`,
then the server must have a LibreOffice service running so that the users of
your site can print documents using the appypdf, appydoc or appyrtf methods (the
appyodt method does not require a LO service). You say this using the
:cmd:`getlino configure --appy` option. For background information see
:doc:`oood`.

For details see the documentation about :ref:`getlino`.

Check :xfile:`/etc/aliases`
===========================

Every production server should be able to send emails to its maintainers, e.g.
to notify them when a cron job fails.

::

  $ sudo apt install sendmail
  $ sudo nano /etc/aliases   # add your email address
  $ sudo newaliases


Install your first site
=======================

You will do the following for every new site on your server.

   $ sudo env PATH=$PATH getlino startsite application_name site_name

Point your browser to http://first.localhost

- ``application_name`` is one of the known Lino applications (noi, cosi, avanti, voga...)

- ``site_name`` is the unique internal name of your site on this server.


Some useful additions to your shell
===================================

Add the following to your system-wide :file:`/etc/bash.bashrc`:

.. literalinclude:: bash_aliases

If you want :ref:`log2syslog`, then add also this:

.. literalinclude:: log2syslog

After these changes you must close and reopen your terminal to activate them.
You can now do the following to quickly cd to a project directory and activate
its Python environment::

  $ go prj1
  $ a

To activate a hourly health check::

  $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/healthcheck.sh /etc/cron.hourly/
