.. _lino.admin.install:

====================================================
Installing a Lino application on a production server
====================================================

Here is a system of files and conventions which we suggest to use when
hosting a Lino production site.  It suits well for having multiple
sites on a same machine.

Prerequisites
=============

You need shell access to a **Linux server**, i.e. a virtual or
physical machine with a Linux operating system running in a network.

We recommend a **stable Debian** as operating system.  If you prefer
some other Linux distribution, that should be no problem. There will
be some differences, but you probably know them.  You need a **web
server**, **Python 2**, some database (e.g. **MySQL** or
**PostGreSQL**) running on that server.

If your customers want want to access their Lino from outside of their
intranet, then you need to setup a **domain name** and configure
Apache to use secure HTTP.


System users
============

Create one or several users who will be the *maintainers* of this
site::

    $ sudo adduser joe

Maintainers must be members of the `sudo` and `www-data` groups::
  
    $ sudo adduser joe sudo
    $ sudo adduser joe www-data

They must have a umask 002 or 007::

    $ nano /home/joe/.bashrc
  
.. rubric:: Notes

- `useradd` is a native binary compiled with the system, while
  `adduser` is a perl script which uses `useradd` in back-end.


Install a development environment
=================================

Follow the instructions in :doc:`/dev/install` for installing a
*development* version of Lino.


More Debian packages
====================

Some Debian packages and why you might need them::

    $ sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi
    $ sudo a2enmod wsgi

This will automatically install Apache 
(packages apache2 apache2-doc apache2-mpm-prefork libexpat1...)

Select your database backend::

    $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server

or::

    $ sudo apt-get install mariadb-server

See :doc:`mysql_install`.

.. _lino.admin.site_module:

    
Configuring site-wide default settings
======================================

Lino applications (unlike Django projects) have a hook for specifying
site-wide default values for their Django settings.

As root, create a directory :file:`/usr/local/src/lino` containing an
empty :xfile:`__init__.py` file::

  $ sudo mkdir /usr/local/src/lino
  $ sudo touch /usr/local/src/lino/__init__.py

In that directory, create a file named :file:`lino_local.py`::
  
  $ sudo nano /usr/local/src/lino/lino_local.py

Paste the following content into that file:

.. literalinclude:: mypy/lino_local.py

Adapt that content to your site.

This will be your :xfile:`lino_local.py` file.

More about this in :ref:`lino.site_module`.


Users and projects
==================

When hosting Lino projects, you may

- create a new Linux user for every project
- define a single user who manages multiple projects
- use a mixture of both

Every user should create a directory which will be the root for all
Lino projects.  We suggest to call it :file:`~/mypy`.  So our project
directories will be :file:`~/mypy/prj1`, :file:`~/mypy/prj2` etc.

Project directories
===================

Every new project directory must have at least three files:

- a file :xfile:`settings.py`:

  .. literalinclude:: mypy/prj1/settings.py
                      
- a file :xfile:`manage.py`:

  .. literalinclude:: mypy/prj1/manage.py

- a file :xfile:`wsgi.py` :

  .. literalinclude:: mypy/prj1/wsgi.py

Note that :xfile:`manage.py` and :xfile:`wsgi.py` have the same
content for every project. Once you have a first project running, you
can add new projects by copying the directory of some existing
project.

We recommend the convention of having in each project a symbolic link
named :xfile:`env` which points to the virtualenv.


Which database backend to use
=============================

Our example assumes you are using Django's **MySQL** backend.  For
other backends, adapt your :setting:`DATABASES` accordingly.

The database backend of your choice is not automatically installed.
If you plan to use Django's MySQL backend, see :doc:`mysql_install`.

Follow the Django documentation at `Get your database running
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/install/#get-your-database-running>`__



Activate file logging
=====================

To activate logging to a file, you simply add a symbolic link named
:xfile:`log` which points to the actual location::

  $ cd ~/mypy/prj1/
  $ ln -s /var/log/lino/prj1 log
 
Create two empty directories :xfile:`media` and :xfile:`config`::

  $ mkdir media
  $ mkdir config

 

Collecting static files
=======================

(Needs revision)

One part of your cache directory are the static files.  When your
:envvar:`LINO_CACHE_ROOT` is set, you should run Django's
:manage:`collectstatic` command::

    $ cd ~/repositories/book/lino_book/projects/polly
    $ python manage.py collectstatic

The output should be something like this::

    You have requested to collect static files at the destination
    location as specified in your settings:

        /home/myname/virtualenvs/a/lino_cache/collectstatic

    This will overwrite existing files!
    Are you sure you want to do this?

    Type 'yes' to continue, or 'no' to cancel: yes

    4688 static files copied to '/home/myname/virtualenvs/a/lino_cache/collectstatic', 0 unmodified.

Note that you can chose an arbitrary project directory (any subdir
below :mod:`lino_book.projects` should do it) for running
:manage:`collectstatic`, it does not need to be :mod:`polly
<lino_book.projects.polly>`. That's because all Lino applications have
the same set of staticfiles.

You need to do this only for your first local Lino project because
static files are the same for every Lino application.  (There are
exceptions to this rule, but we can ignore them for the moment.)
  
 
  
Install TinyMCE language packs
==============================

(Needs revision)

If you plan to use Lino in other languages than English, you must 
manually install language packs for TinyMCE from
http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/i18n/index.php?ctrl=lang&act=download&pr_id=1

Simplified instructions for a language pack containing 
my personal selection (de, fr, nl and et)::

  # cd /usr/share/tinymce/www
  # wget http://tim.saffre-rumma.net/dl/tmp/tinymce_language_pack.zip
  # unzip tinymce_language_pack.zip
