Being a Lino hosting provider
=============================

As a qualified *Lino hosting provider* you assume the following
**responsibilities**:

- You set up a virtual machine running some Linux, usually Debian,
  where a maintainer will have SSH access.

- You care about registering a domain name and SSH certificates if the
  customer needs it.

- you care about security and protect the system against hackers
  
- you make backups of the data to make sure it doesn't get lost in
  case of a serious accident.
  
- you care about scaling. When a customer's site grows, then they
  might want to move to a bigger machine.

- you care about reliability and make sure that the Lino site is
  always available to respond when your customer needs it.

- you help end-users with certain problems.


If you are able to provide these services, you should ask for being listed in
