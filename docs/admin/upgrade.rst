Upgrading a Lino production site
================================

This document gives generic instructions for upgrading a Lino
production site to a new version.  This procedure is suitable for
smaller sites with one contact person.  See :doc:`/admin/preview` for
are more sophisticated approach on sites with many users.  See also
:doc:`/dev/datamig` for technical background information.


- Go to your project directory::

    $ go myproject

  See :cmd:`go` if you don't know that command.

- Activate the python environment (we usually have a shell alias
  :cmd:`a` which expands to ``. env/bin/activate``)::

    $ a

- Stop any services that might want to write to the database (web server,
  supervisor)::

    $ sudo service apache2 stop  # not needed when the server runs nginx
    $ sudo service supervisor stop

- Run :xfile:`make_snapshot.sh` to make a snapshot of your database::

    $ ./make_snapshot.sh

  See :doc:`/admin/snapshot` for details.

- Run :xfile:`pull.sh` to update the source code::

    $ pull.sh

- Run the :manage:`install` command to install any new Python dependencies if needed::

    $ python manage.py install

- Run the :manage:`collectstatic` command::

    $ python manage.py collectstatic

  This step can be skipped if there were no changes in the static files.

That's all **if there is no change in the database structure**. But if
there was (or if you don't know whether there was) some change which
requires a data migration, then you must continue:

- Restore the snapshot::

    $ python manage.py run snapshot/restore.py

Note that a :xfile:`restore.py` can take considerable time depending
on the size of your database.  So if you *believe* but are not
absolutely sure there was *no change* in the database structure, then
you can check whether you need to run :xfile:`restore.py` by doing a
second temporary snapshot and then comparing their :xfile:`restore.py`
files.  If nothing has changed, then you don't need to run it::

    $ python manage.py dump2py -o t
    $ diff snapshot/restore.py t/restore.py

- Start the web server and supervisor::

    $ sudo service apache2 start
    $ sudo service supervisor start
