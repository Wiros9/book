Hosting Guide
===================

This part of the documentation is for :term:`server administrators <server
administrator>` who set up or maintain a server that hosts one or several Lino
:term:`production sites <production site>`.

The approaches described in this document are not mandatory. Hosting a
Lino site is technically the same as hosting a `Django
<https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ project.  If you are already
hosting Django projects, you might prefer to use your existing system
of approaches.  But even experienced Django hosters might find
interesting tricks or inspiration for their system by reading how we
recommend to do it.
