Postfix cheat sheet
===================

**Postfix** is a mail transfer agent (MTA). We prefer it over exim4 just because
we have a cheat sheet for it. There have been long debates on what (if any)
should be the default MTA for a Debian system (`more
<https://wiki.debian.org/Debate/DefaultMTA>`__).


Installation
============

Installing Postfix on Debian is easy::

  $ sudo apt install libsasl2-modules postfix

This will automatically uninstall exim4.

Installing postfix will start by asking you to select the **configuration
type**. Choose "Internet site".  See below for other choices.

It will then ask for your "mail name", this is the fully qualified domain name
of your server.


Configuration type
==================

Installing postfix will start by asking you to select the mail server
**configuration type** that best meets your needs.

- Internet site:  Mail is sent and received directly using SMTP.

- Internet with smarthost: Mail is received directly using SMTP or by running a
  utility such as fetchmail. Outgoing mail is sent using a smarthost.

- Satellite system:
  All mail is sent to another machine, called a 'smarthost', for delivery.

The configuration is then stored in a file
:xfile:`/etc/postfix/main.cf`, which you can modify afterwards.

For laudate we had to activate (uncomment) the ``smtps`` entry in
:xfile:`/etc/postfix/master.cf`.


.. xfile:: /etc/postfix/main.cf

This is the main configuration file for postfix. See the `postfix documentation
<http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html>`__ about the syntax and meaning of the
parameters in this file.

Notes about parameters used on a typical Lino server:

- relayhost : Empty when this server speaks directly to the smtp servers of the recipients.  
- relay_domains
- myhostname
- myorigin
- mydomain
- mydestination

Using a relay host
==================

Set the name of the relay host in the ``relayhost`` parameter::

  relayhost = relay.ovh.com

If the relay host requires a username and password::

  $ sudo nano /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
  $ sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

Here is our suggestion for your :xfile:`/etc/postfix/main.cf` file::

  myhostname = mail.myname.org
  myorigin = /etc/mailname
  mydestination = $myhostname localhost.$mydomain localhost $mydomain
  relayhost =
  mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128
  mynetworks_style = host
  relay_domains =
  inet_interfaces = all

Here is what status should say::

  $ sudo service postfix status
  ‚óè postfix.service - Postfix Mail Transport Agent
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postfix.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Thu 2019-12-12 12:01:59 UTC; 7s ago
    Process: 2262 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 2262 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)

  Dec 12 12:01:59 my-host-name systemd[1]: Starting Postfix Mail Transport Agent...
  Dec 12 12:01:59 my-host-name systemd[1]: Started Postfix Mail Transport Agent.

Diagnostic tips and tricks
==========================

To quickly see the value of a given parameter, type::

  $ sudo postconf | grep mydomain

How to send a simple mail for testing the mail system::

  $ mail -s "some test" joe@example.com mike@example.com



Inspect the mail queue
======================

Display a list of queued mail (deferred and pending)::

  $ mailq

Display the content of queued mail::

  $ sudo postcat -vq <QueueID>

Display the mail log::

  $ sudo less /var/log/mail.log

Delete all queued mail::

  $ sudo postsuper -d ALL

Delete deferred mail queue messages::

  $ sudo postsuper -d ALL deferred


Common problems when running your own mail server
=================================================

:message:`550 Email blocked` means that the recipient's mail server refuses to
accept an incoming mail because the sender's mail server is blacklisted.

To see whether your server is blacklisted, you can ask
http://multirbl.valli.org/lookup/

For some nice examples of why blacklisting is needed, see  `bobcares.com
