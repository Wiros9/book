This is the code repository with the big Sphinx documentation tree
about the Lino framework.  A build of this tree is published on
`www.lino-framework.org <http://www.lino-framework.org>`__ and on
`lino.readthedocs.io <http://lino.readthedocs.io>`__.

It also contains the ``lino_book`` Python package, a collection of
small example Lino applications used for educational and testing
purposes.

The code repositories for the ``lino`` and ``lino_xl`` Python packages
have no documentation tree on their own, their documentation is here.

It also contains a test suite with doctest-based tests for all these
packages.
