The Lino Book is a code repository used for educational and testing
purposes.  It contains the big Sphinx documentation tree about the
Lino framework published on http://www.lino-framework.org/.

It also contains the ``lino_book`` Python package, a collection of
small example Lino applications.

The code repositories for the ``lino`` and ``lino_xl`` Python packages
have no documentation tree on their own, their documentation is here.

It also contains a big test suite which runs doctest-based tests for
all these packages.
